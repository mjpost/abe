# Interpolation
The interpolation baseline requires our bilingual models (for instance [rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25](https://huggingface.co/rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25)).

Translations generated by our models are available in the `interpolation/outputs` folder.

The translations within the `sentences` folder are the sentence-segmented translations while `targets` files have been recombined for scoring.

You can see the `translate.sh` file for how all calls were made.

# Simple Translations
These are the translations generated by the individual models.

The scripts used to generate are found in the `simple-translations/scripts` folder. `bilingual.py` requires our models (for instance [rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25](https://huggingface.co/rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25)).
