3	Tierra del Sol is pleased to present "Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water" at the new gallery location in West Hollywood.
3	Siso has been an artist in the Studio Arts Program since 2012, this marks his debut solo exhibition.
3	Siso was born 1962 in Madrid and raised between Venezuela, Trinidad and Miami; he moved with his family to Southern California in his early 20s.
4	Masterfully working across subject matter, Siso has generated a prolific series of landscapes, portraits, and still-life works rendered in either acrylic, pastel, pencil or watercolor.
4	Drawing from family portraits, his own reference photographs, and recollection, his colorful compositions demonstrate his range of interests and skill across media.
4	Siso's tropical landscapes and seascapes reflect the geographies of his past, employing rich patterns and incorporating people to make meaningful connections between culture, memory and the environment.
4	Siso titles his artworks in a mix of Spanish and English, signifying the celebrated and integral complexities of his life in Los Angeles County.
4	"Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water" opens on Saturday, Jan. 13, with a reception from 6-8 p.m.
4	The exhibition is on view through Sunday, March 3.
5	The Tierra del Sol Gallery is located at 7414 Santa Monica Blvd.

6	Adapt the old, accommodate the new to solve issue
7	At the precinct level, we just need to look at the Sydney CBD as an example of an area which has grown from its pre-settlement landscape into a two-storey city, from a maximum height of 150 feet to the soaring towers of today.
7	At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes.
7	Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites.
7	Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure.
8	Our planning system also needs to adapt so that planners in suburban councils, who seem to be less supportive of change, are not the only determinants of the future shape of their suburbs.
8	A way forward could be to have an independent decision-making body that championed quality design as long as it fitted below the tree tops and incorporated family living, large balconies, common gardens and presented a friendly appearance.
8	This could be a role for the current NSW government architect working within a carefully crafted complying code.
9	Over the past decade, our lives have changed through technology, with many working from home, and Sydney has gained an impressive network of metro and light rail systems.
9	Our ability to purchase online has changed the way we shop, and friends and family seem closer because of smartphone communication.
9	All of these adaptations from one system to another can also occur in our built environment through a planning focus on adaptive reuse rather than preferencing heritage preservation.

11	A final push for female equality
12	Last year, the World Economic Forum forecast that it would take five generations to achieve gender equality in every nation.
12	Now the World Bank wants to rapidly accelerate that time frame.
13	The international financial institution is poised to launch a strategy aimed at significantly advancing the rights and economic opportunities for girls and women by 2030.
13	The plan focuses on improving inclusivity and resilience through access to finance, technological innovation, and changes in public policy and law.
14	"Recent research demonstrates that both social norms and mindsets can change, for example, that engaging men and boys can foster their support and buy-in for gender equality," a consultative draft of the plan states.
14	"Positive gender outcomes can be accelerated and scaled with a better understanding of ... how social norms and mindsets shape everyday expectations, priorities, and practices."
15	Shifts in thought are harder to quantify than bank loans for rural women or school enrollment for girls.
15	Yet there is plenty of evidence that female agency can move mountains.
15	In Iran, for example, women have led the greatest threat to the Islamic government in 40 years simply by refusing to comply with laws that force them to cover their hair.
15	In some of the 130 countries with minimum quotas for female representation in government, such as India, male resistance to female voting and political activism has eased.
16	In some rural African communities, civil society organizations are replacing a harmful rite of passage with health education.
16	One such program helped Kamanda Timayio, leader of the Masai village of Maparasha, Kenya, change his mind about female genital mutilation.
16	He told Le Monde that he had "emerged from ignorance" and would abandon the practice.
17	The World Bank cites other examples.
17	From 1970 to 2022, Bangladesh quadrupled female literacy rates and doubled female participation in the labor force.
17	Its gross domestic product more than tripled.
17	The change gathered its own momentum.
17	Recruiting salaried women as teachers and health workers from within their own communities boosted trust "and made women's mobility and work more socially acceptable."
18	The bank's plan would target norms and institutions that may still require generational shifts.
18	It has taken Rwanda more than two decades to establish itself as a model for land reforms that boost economic empowerment for women."No one benefits if women are held back," Rwanda President Paul Kagame said, arguing for land reform in 2015.
18	"We have to change mindsets, not just the laws."
19	The World Bank hopes to spread that message.
20	German farmers and train drivers are scaring Germany's bosses
21	In Germany, where workers and bosses run many companies jointly, a big strike is unusual.
21	A wave of big strikes is almost unheard of.
21	Right now the country of "co-determination" is simultaneously facing an eight-day "action week" by irate farmers, who blocked roads with tractors, a three-day strike of railway workers and, to top it off, a looming strike of doctors, who already closed surgeries between Christmas and New Year's Day.
21	This Mistgabelmop (pitchfork mob), as some have taken to calling it, will test Germany's harmonious labour relations in the year to come.
22	The protests were ostensibly set off by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles.
22	These measures pushed farmers over the edge.
22	It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity.
22	On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay.
23	In an effort to defuse the tension with the farmers, the government agreed to a gradual removal of the diesel subsidy over three years and to keeping the exemption from the car tax.
23	The farmers pooh-poohed the concessions as insufficient.
23	On January 4th an aggressive group of them prevented Robert Habeck, the economy minister, from disembarking from a ferry on his return from a family holiday.
23	If the train drivers are similarly unimpressed, that could prove expensive for German business, reckons IW Köln, a think-tank.
23	The rail strike could cost businesses €100m ($110m) a day if it forced them to interrupt production.
23	The car, chemical and steel industries, Germany's biggest, are especially reliant on rail transport.
24	The workers" mood is increasingly angry.
24	"Appeals are circulating with fantasies of revolution," warned Mr Habeck.
24	The far-right Alternative for Germany party is doing its best to fan the grievances.
24	In Dresden the Free Saxons, another far-right group, infiltrated the farmers" protest calling for the "extinction of the traffic light" (as the governing coalition of the Social Democrats, Free Democrats and Greens is referred to because of their party colours).
25	Thomas Puls of IW Köln fears that the strikes will harm the image of Germany as a place for business.
25	Local bosses are already fretting about a German version of the gilets jaunes protests in France in 2018, which culminated in yellow-jacketed demonstrators torching cars on the Champs-Elysées and the police stepping in with tear gas.
25	Jochen Kopelke, head of Germany's police union, warned in an interview with Tagesspiegel, a daily, that the farmers were probably "just the start of an enormous wave of protest this year."
25	Germany was the only big economy to shrink in 2023, and the year ended on an especially sour note, with an unexpected drop in business confidence in December.
25	This year is shaping up to be even tougher.
26	Brewers froth over winemakers" exemption from anti-waste rules
27	As the EU debates rules to limit packaging waste, beer producers argue they are being unfairly discriminated against with exemptions for winemakers from reuse targets and deposit-return schemes, but one of Europe's wine industry association chiefs says brewers should "mind their own business."
28	European brewers have warned that exempting wine and not beer from deposit return schemes and reuse targets is unfair and potentially illegal, as lawmakers enter final talks over a new law designed to turn a surging tide of packaging waste across the EU.
29	Environment ministers agreed an EU Council negotiating mandate on the proposed Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) before Christmas, paving the way for imminent political talks with the European Parliament, which are already underway at the technical level.
30	"Our position is clear," the trade association Brewers of Europe wrote to MEPs and government negotiators (10 January).
30	"If targets and mandatory requirements in the PPWR apply to beer then there is a legal obligation that they apply to all alcoholic beverage categories."
31	The 18 December ministerial summit yielded a carve out for winemakers from the requirement that, by the end of the decade, 10% of products must be supplied in reusable containers within a system for reuse or refill, rising to 40% in 2040.
31	The exemption would also apply to the requirement, likewise supported by the European Parliament, that wine should be exempt from deposit-return schemes that should be put in place by 2029 under the proposal.
32	Both the Czech and Belgian ministers immediately expressed reservations at the 18 December summit about the unequal treatment for brewers, but acquiesced.
32	Belgium, which now chairs the rotating EU Council presidency and is therefore in principle neutral in terms of inter-governmental negotiations, hopes to clinch a deal with the parliament by early March.
33	Ignacio Sánchez Recarte, secretary general of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins trade association representing some 7,000 wine producers across Europe, is dismissive of the concerns of the beer makers.
33	He told Euronews that a market dominated by multinational brewing conglomerates bears no comparison with one comprised almost entirely of small, domestic producers.
34	More than 99% of the domestic wine sector is made up of micro- to medium-sized companies, Sánchez Recarte said, questioning the solidity of legal arguments made by brewers and asserting that his organisation had focused on presenting policy makers with information "relevant and appropriate" to its own industry.
35	"It is not my role to estimate if the beer sector should have this or that target, as it would depend on the intrinsic characteristics of their own sector," Sánchez Recarte said.
35	"In the same way, brewers should mind their own business and focus on their own responsibilities."
36	Brewers of Europe shared with Euronews a brief legal analysis it sent to the European Commission last year, where it argues that wine and beer are competing products that are "at least partially, substitutable with each other," and which argued that rules favouring one over the other would distort the market.
37	Simon Spillane, the lobby group's head of operations, said brewers were "already leading the way" in packaging sustainability, citing the example of beer kegs being reused around 165 times before being crushed and recycled after 30 years.
37	They support reuse recycling systems already in place in many countries, he said.
38	"We therefore advocate for an ambitious PPWR but need a level playing field in packaging legislation where beer and other alcoholic beverages play by the same rules, with each sector contributing fairly to reaching the targets and supporting collection systems," Spillane told.
38	"Any other approach puts the brewers at a competitive disadvantage."
39	The Biden Administration Is Letting Corporate Criminals Off the Hook
40	Tim Whitehouse, a former EPA enforcement attorney and the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, praised the Biden administration's recent improvements on enforcement while acknowledging the strong headwinds such efforts face.
40	"It takes years of sustained funding and political support to build a good enforcement program," he told me.
40	"The instability in Congress is not only demoralizing to EPA staff but undermines their ability to think strategically over the long term."
41	The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD.
41	Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007.
41	The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on.
41	In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well.
41	As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.
42	The Department of Justice's overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates.
42	While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland's tenure as attorney general - like finally establishing a database on corporate crime - Biden's DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge.
42	Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ's Criminal Division, revised the division's corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions.
43	Government Shutdown Debate Fuels House Republican Civil War
44	Conservative spending hawks in the House of Representatives bucked party leadership today - derailing a series of votes - in protest of Speaker Mike Johnson's recent spending deal with Democratic leadership that they feel does not go far enough in fiscal reductions.
45	While the Louisiana Republican can avoid confronting the issue for now, on January 19 the country will face its deadline to pass four of 12 annual spending bills.
45	Johnson has publicly stated that he would not support a "continuing resolution" (CR) to extend the deadline on these four bills to the February 2 due date for the remaining eight.
46	However, with that deadline just 9 days away, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said Congress will need to pass a CR to keep things open, meaning the speaker may soon break a promise he made, largely to appease his right flank.
46	Such a maneuver could ignite a heated ideological battle in a closely divided House over the GOP's role in spending cuts that may see the government face a partial shutdown or Johnson removed from his job.
47	"I've been very clear that CRs are not the way to fund our government that the Budget Act of 1974 calls for us to pass the 12 appropriation bills," Congressman Matt Rosendale of Montana told Newsweek.
47	"We've had ample time to do that, and if the leadership does not direct the committees to get the work done and the members to be able to vote upon it, that therein lies the breakdown."

49	Rosendale, a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, was one of the individuals who derailed the Wednesday votes.
49	He views the top line number in Johnson's deal as being too high and as doing too little to cut the $34 trillion national debt.
50	Rosendale was also among the 71 Republicans who opposed the Fiscal Responsibility Act struck between Democrats and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a deal that set the parameters for Johnson's recent negotiation with Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer.
51	Johnson celebrated his deal for cutting an estimated $16 billion in spending, but the Freedom Caucus believes he could have gotten more.
51	Moderate Republicans who backed McCarthy's deal see that stance as unrealistic and running counter to the Republican goal of forcing Congress to pass the 12 individual spending bills as opposed to the "omnibus" measure of recent years, which combined those 12 bills into one vote.
52	"New year, same idiotic behavior by some," New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler told Newsweek.
52	"We're not doing an omnibus, so each bill is going to have to be dealt with at conference and negotiated.
52	Obviously, the reality is we're probably gonna need more time to do that.
52	And I don't support a government shutdown, so I have no problem with doing a short-term CR that allows for this process to be completed."
53	Congress has not passed all 12 bills individually since 1996.
53	Lawler said it's worth delaying passage of four of the bills to ensure the process is done right.
53	If Congress cannot pass the 12 bills by December, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a 1 percent budget cut would be applied to defense and non-defense discretionary spending.
54	Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, one of the Republican Party's most vocal budget hawks but not among those who protested the Wednesday vote, said a yearlong CR that triggers the 1 percent spending cut may be the most feasible way to keep the government open while ending ongoing "brinkmanship."
55	However, he said the most "responsible way" to cut spending would be to pass all 12 bills.
55	With many Republicans reticent to see a shutdown and a 1 percent cut to defense spending, the urgency to pass the bills could see enough Republicans ally with Democrats to extend the deadline on the four spending bills and reach an agreement to fund the government, even if doing so puts Johnson in hot water with some of those on the hard right.
56	"That [1 percent cut] is supposed to be motivation and leverage to get 12 separate bills done," Massie told Newsweek.
56	"So, I think we could do a one-year CR, we can argue, and then we hit that tiny little bump in the road, then hopefully everybody's motivated to come to their senses.
56	That's the way I would do it."
57	Regulators Approve New Bitcoin ETFs in Watershed Moment for Crypto
58	The Securities and Exchange Commission begrudgingly approved exchange-traded funds that directly hold bitcoin Wednesday, a move long-awaited by fans of digital currencies and criticized by financial watchdogs skeptical of the crypto industry.
59	The commission authorized 10 exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that invest in bitcoin, including funds proposed by giants such as Blackrock and Fidelity as well as by smaller financial companies.
60	"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.
60	"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto."
61	Gensler also added that the approval of the bitcoin funds did not imply the SEC would approve funds or exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on other digital currencies or assets.
62	"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin.
62	It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.
62	Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission's views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws," Gensler said.
63	The SEC rejected applications for similar funds for years.
63	Last year, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the SEC's refusal to approve an application from Grayscale to convert a derivative fund into one that would directly bitcoin, calling the SEC's position "
64	"Based on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares," Gensler explained.
65	The much-anticipated approval has been hailed as a watershed event for digital currencies that proponents say will broaden access to investing in bitcoin and possibly lead to broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets.
65	The price of bitcoin has exploded higher in recent months, rising from around $25,000 in September to more than $45,000, in part because many bitcoin investors believe the ETFs will create more demand for the asset.
66	Critics blasted the SEC on Wednesday night.
67	Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Better Markets, said the approval is a "an historic mistake that will not only unleash crypto predators on tens of millions of investors and retirees but will also likely undermine financial stability."
68	"With the flagrantly lawless crypto industry crashing and burning due to a mountain of arrests, criminal convictions, bankruptcies, lawsuits, scandals, massive losses, and millions of investor and customer victims, who would have thought that the SEC would come to its rescue by approving a trusted and familiar investment vehicle that will enable the mass marketing of a known worthless, volatile, and fraud-filled financial product to Main Street Americans," Kelleher said.
69	Complaints of Russian language use in Ukraine rise 30% - RT Russia & Former Soviet Union
70	Authorities are urging the population to file reports in a bid to de-Russify the country
71	The number of complaints to authorities in Ukraine of a person speaking in Russian increased by 30% last year.
71	Kiev actively encourages the population to report such cases in a bid to allegedly 'protect' the country from Russian influence.
72	According to the office of the commissioner for the protection of the state language, 3,692 language law violations were reported in 2023.
72	Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa remain "leaders in terms of the number of complaints of violations.
72	Therefore, strict controls over the observance of the language rights of citizens in all spheres of public life should be among the priorities of community leaders this year," Taras Kremen, the country's Language Ombudsman said.
73	Kremen also confirmed that a 3,400 hryvnia ($89) fine had been imposed on a Kiev taxi driver who serviced his clients in Russian.
73	The ombudsman reminded the public of a "detailed algorithm of actions in case of violation of the right to receive information or services in the state language," urging people to immediately file complaints on the commissioner's website when such cases occur.
74	In 2019, Ukraine adopted a law that makes using the Ukrainian language obligatory in all spheres of public life, including government, medicine, science, education, and the media.
74	Failure to comply can result in fines.
74	Since 2022, when the military conflict with Russia began, Ukraine has undertaken a campaign of total de-Russification, with MPs saying it is necessary in order to defend against Russian influence.
74	Local authorities have introduced complete bans on Russian-language works of art, performances, books, films, songs, and its study in schools and universities, and recommended that schoolchildren communicate in Ukrainian even during breaks.
75	Last August, a teenage signer was briefly detained and forced to record a video apology following a performance of Soviet singer Viktor Tsoy's songs on the street in the city of Lviv.
75	The dismissal of several teachers who spoke Russian to their students also resulted in a public outcry.
76	The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, has previously said "the Russian language must disappear" from the territory of Ukraine "as an element of hostile propaganda and brainwashing of the population."
77	Moscow maintains that such laws violate the rights of Russian-speaking people, who make up around half of Ukraine's population.
77	Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in February that Kiev's "discriminatory campaign" against the language was growing more and more "indignant."
77	In a survey conducted last September by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, respondents cited language discrimination as the most common type of prejudice in Ukraine, with 45% saying it was a problem.
78	Don't let SNP to turn health service crisis into the "new normal" - Scotsman comment
79	As the latest tranche of NHS figures reveals more bad news, we should be outraged
80	An 83-hour wait in a hospital A&E; four-in-ten patients waiting longer than four hours; 30 ambulances queuing outside a hospital, unable to respond to other emergency calls; staff "leaving shifts in tears" over the standard of care and "a near collapse of performance," according to an expert at the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.
81	If anyone dares to say that Scotland's NHS is not in a state of crisis or that these are just the usual winter problems, we should be outraged.
81	The danger is that politicians like the embattled Health Secretary, Michael Matheson, will succeed in their efforts to convince us that, while regrettable, this is somehow acceptable, that there is nothing more that ministers can do in the circumstances, that this is the new normal.
82	Amid calls for his resignation over the abject failure of the SNP's NHS recovery plan, Matheson spoke of how the "heightened winter pressure" was "not unique to Scotland."
82	Instead of "blame Westminster," the attempted defence this time was "Westminster's just as bad," as if that provided any comfort to the legions of patients forced to wait for hours on end in pain and distress.
83	He admitted that the age-old problem of delayed discharge - in which patients well enough to leave hospital cannot do so, often because the necessary social care is not available - was a "major factor," but claimed an action plan was being "implemented at pace."
83	Given this has been a persistent issue for years, few will have high hopes the SNP has finally found a solution.
84	Indeed, new Public Health Scotland figures show the situation is actually getting worse: 1,910 people were delayed in hospital in November, up from 1,730 in April.
84	One reason why ambulances cannot drop off patients promptly is that A&E departments are full because wards are full.
85	Judging by the state of our hospitals, the SNP's talk of recovery plans and action plans is simply that - talk, and dangerous talk at that.
85	We must not allow incompetent politicians to lull us into complicity in the demise of that great British institution, the National Health Service.
86	Construction waste recycling firm opens new Cumbernauld plant amid circular economy drive
87	Move will also help transform land at the derelict Gartshore Works site.
88	A Scottish recycling business that has already processed more than a million tonnes of construction waste has opened a second plant following a multi-million pound investment.
89	Brewster Brothers" wash plants transform 100 per cent of the excavated soils and rubble they process from the construction industry into high-value aggregates for reuse.
89	Over the past six years, the firm's site near Livingston, West Lothian has prevented almost 1.35 million tonnes of construction, demolition and excavation waste going to landfill.
89	It has created more than one million tonnes of recycled aggregates to sell into the industry.
90	As part of a £6 million-plus expansion of the business, Brewster has now opened its second recycling site, regenerating the old Gartshore Works near Cumbernauld.
90	The new plant will serve construction sites, housing and utilities developments in the western part of the Central Belt.
90	The plant near Livingston, which currently employs 39 people, will continue to provide sustainable waste management services and recycled aggregates to businesses in Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians.
91	Scott Brewster, managing director, who set up the business in 2017 alongside his father, Alex, said: "It's increasingly clear that the construction sector in Scotland appreciates the need to reduce the amount of natural resources that the industry uses and the amount of carbon it emits while increasing use of recycled and secondary materials.
91	The volume of construction, demolition and excavation waste that's been recycled over the last six years has grown enormously, and our investment into this second site demonstrates that there's room for a further expansion in this area.
92	"Scotland has big ambitions for transitioning to a circular economy, and the government plans to bring in a new devolved aggregates tax that should accelerate the shift away from the use of virgin products."
93	As part of the firm's redevelopment of the derelict Gartshore Works site it has recruited new members of staff supported by Scottish Enterprise's Green Jobs Fund.
93	The firm will also recycle the old bing of colliery waste on the site, and the area will be turned into a country park for the local community.
94	Politicians get it wrong when it comes to rent caps
95	There is always the temptation for politicians to intervene in situations where they think they can make a difference.
95	Of course, if there was an obvious simple solution to a problem somebody with more knowledge and understanding of the problems would already have implemented it.
96	Thus, we had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis.
96	What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes.
96	Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.
97	There were plenty of warnings from all involved in the housing sector that this would happen, but these went unheeded.
97	An unwillingness to believe that market forces are what dictates prices rather than government has led to enormous rent price rises which could have been avoided with greater understanding, negotiation and discussion with the sector and a plan that understood the principles of supply and demand.
98	With the Cost of Living Act legislation ending on 31 March 2024, a new consultation document seeks to extend controls on the level of rent increases that can be levied in the coming year.
98	The consultation ends this Monday and proposes rents be set by the lowest of three comparators: open market rent; a landlord's proposed new rent; and a "reasonable" increase devised from a new taper system using comparison with a percentage of market rent.
99	Scottish tenants are likely to face further alarming rent increases if experts are not heeded (Picture: Adobe)
100	This tapering proposal would set rent increases between 6 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent which, ironically, would be higher than historic annual price rises.
100	But, more importantly, this scheme would be unwieldy, overly complex and prohibitively expensive to monitor and implement.
100	We already have a system involving the first-tier housing tribunal which rules on whether a rent increase is fair.
100	This seems like adding further layers of bureaucracy with no gain for landlords or tenants.
101	Unfortunately, this consultation paper seems like a further attempt to impose controls on the sector.
101	A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months.
101	To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing.
101	The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market.
101	Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.
101	Only by adopting these measures will we start to address the current housing crisis.
101	Anything else is simply not going to work.
102	Greggs plans to make more dough with major further branch expansion while holding prices
103	FTSE 250 firm famous for sausage rolls and steak bakes plans to rise branch network but not prices.
104	High-street bakery chain Greggs has said that in the year ahead it does not plan to hike prices, and is aiming to open 160 branches as it targets locations outside city centres.
105	Chief executive Roisin Currie told PA she has "no plans currently" to up prices at the till as it expects a more stable cost base over the year ahead.
105	However, she added that it would be "a long time before we see deflation" that would allow the group to start reducing prices, with retailers among those facing higher wage bills due to increases in the national living wage - although she added that the trend of bigger pay packets is "good news as it puts more money into consumers" pockets."
106	Greggs has also revealed plans to debut up to another 160 stores in the year ahead, and cheered a strong end to 2023.
106	The group opened a record 220 new shops over 2023, with 33 closures and 42 relocations, leaving it with 145 new sites on a net basis and taking its total estate to 2,473.
107	The FTSE 250 firm is to open between 140 and 160 outlets on a net basis in 2024 as it looks to give customers more convenient access to its stores.
107	It will keep looking at expanding across retail parks, travel sites, and roadside locations, plus industrial estates.
107	Currie said: "Where there's any location where you can't currently access a Greggs easily, we want to try and get into that location."
108	It also plans to continue rolling out evening opening hours on a targeted basis, with extended hours currently available in around 1,200 of its shops.
108	The firm in a trading update posted a 9.4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales across its own-managed shops in the fourth quarter, a slowdown on the 14.2 per cent growth seen in the previous three months, as Greggs said there was less contribution from price inflation.
108	It saw full-year comparable growth of 13.7 per cent, with total full-year sales up by a fifth to £1.8 billion.
109	The business also said it continued to see strong demand for vegan options, having recently brought back the vegan steak bake, as well as Christmas ranges, including its festive bake, chocolate orange muffin, and Christmas lunch baguette.
110	Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Greggs "can tick off 2023 as a year of real progress" on the back of extended opening hours, more delivery options, improving supply-chain capacity, and "a fresh new suite of tasty treats."
110	He added: "Festive bakes and chocolate orange muffins lead the way over Christmas, but bears may point to sales growth slowing over the year, and the fourth quarter was the lowest of 2023.
110	That's largely because Greggs was able to limit price hikes as inflation cooled.
110	Longer-term, that's a net positive.
111	"One of Greggs' key strengths is offering a lower-value treat and keeping that proposition intact is key, especially when consumer incomes are stretched.
111	The most important thing is to see volumes trend higher, and that remains the case.
111	The job's not done.
111	Expect to see more progress over 2024 as investment continues into the digital offering, delivery partnerships and expanding the store estate."
112	Rishi Sunak's law to strike down wrongful convictions may have serious unintended consequences - Scotsman comment
113	Politicians who think they can overturn judges" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law
114	As has been pointed out for years by, among others, The Scotsman, the wrongful conviction of hundreds of Post Office branch managers in the Horizon scandal is one of the most serious miscarriages of justice in history.
114	People were sent to prison, lost homes, marriages and reputations, and endured the mental torment of an honest person treated as a criminal.
115	While the root cause of their problems was the flawed Horizon computer system, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake told MPs yesterday that the evidence showed "not only incompetence but malevolence" by the Post Office.
115	He lamented that just 95 out of more than 900 convictions had been overturned.
115	Now, a new law is to be introduced in England and Wales to exonerate the scandal's victims, with Downing Street saying it will work with the Scottish Government on similar steps.
116	It is extraordinary what can be achieved by a poignant television drama - ITV's Mr Bates Vs The Post Office - in an election year.
116	After years of inaction, politicians are suddenly falling over themselves to do something.
116	However, there are problems with Rishi Sunak's approach.
117	The first is that a blanket law clearing hundreds of people may inadvertently include some who were guilty but, given the pressing need to clear the innocent, this may be a price worth paying.
117	The second is more serious.
117	A law overturning court verdicts may set a dangerous precedent at a time when populists are testing the boundaries of political power.
118	In the US, Donald Trump is attempting to claim that, as president, he had immunity from prosecution.
118	In the UK, Boris Johnson illegally suspended parliament to facilitate his Brexit plans, while Sunak wants to overturn a Supreme Court decision that Rwanda is not a safe country by passing a law to say that it is.
119	The concept of the separation of powers - the government, parliament and the judiciary - is a vital safeguard against tyranny.
119	Politicians who think they can strike down judges" decisions are effectively putting themselves above the law.
119	Voters must make clear this is not a position they will tolerate in anything other than the most extreme circumstances.
120	Bring back oversight for WA's jails.
120	Lives depend on it
121	The Washington jail system is experiencing a fatality crisis.
121	This is one of the uncomfortable but unavoidable truths we confronted as co-chairs of a legislative task force charged with studying our state's jail system and recommending changes to help make jails safer.
121	Although we come from a variety of backgrounds, including jail administration, civil rights advocacy, and experience being incarcerated in jail, we all agree that there must be independent oversight of Washington's jails.
122	More than 130,000 people were booked into a Washington jail in 2022, and yet there is startlingly little information about what occurs once they get there.
122	Washington has no statewide office responsible for monitoring jails and reporting data to the public.
122	Some of the only information available relates to deaths in custody.
123	What we found demonstrates that immediate action is required.
123	Even accounting for Washington's population growth, the Washington jail death rate nearly tripled between 2000 and 2019 - an increase 16 times that of the national average.
123	Outpacing other states, Washington now has the fourth-highest rate of jail deaths in the nation.
123	This cannot continue.
124	Reversing the trend of jail deaths, and solving the many other issues facing our jails, may require some difficult policy decisions.
124	However, independent oversight of jails is a critical first step toward a safer and more humane jail system.
124	Independent oversight is a demonstrated means of improving transparency and accountability both in Washington and across the country.
124	By our count, at least 25 states have a statewide office responsible for overseeing jails, and all of them have a lower rate of jail deaths than Washington.
125	Closer to home, Washington has recently established or expanded independent oversight of state prisons, police, schools, and other entities.
125	Jails are the notable exception to oversight of institutions that are responsible for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people.
126	An independent jail oversight office can monitor conditions in jails, meet with staff and incarcerated people, report on conditions that they have witnessed firsthand, and even communicate concerns before people are hurt.
126	A jail oversight office can also collect and report data, helping administrators, policymakers, and the public understand our jail system and advocate for data-driven solutions to jail deaths and other problems relating to jails.
127	Oversight is not only for the benefit of incarcerated people.
127	Our task force recognized that an oversight office can partner with overburdened jail systems to provide much-needed assistance and recommendations, including smart policies that promote staff safety and reduce recidivism.
128	Washington state briefly had a statewide jail oversight office from 1981-87, which the United States Department of Justice once trumpeted as a model for systems around the country.
128	Unfortunately, the Legislature eliminated statewide jail oversight over the objections of jail administrators, civil rights groups, and others.
129	Independent oversight will promote public trust and data-driven decision-making in a field that has for too long operated without the benefit of transparency.
129	We ask the Legislature to enact into law our task force's recommendation to restore independent oversight of our state's city, county, and regional jails.
129	People's lives depend on it.

132	How to find out if you're flying on a Boeing 737 MAX
133	For most travelers, the aircraft model isn't a deciding factor when booking a flight.
133	But with the majority of Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets grounded around the country after an Alaska Airlines fuselage blowout on Jan. 6, some prospective passengers may want to know how to tell what type of plane they'll be on and which models are the safest.
133	The first is easy enough to answer - the second is a little more complicated.
134	The airplane model is typically noted in the booking information for a flight.
134	On Google Flights, it's included in the flight details when a listing is expanded, and it's usually listed on individual airlines" reservation pages.
134	If, for some reason, the plane type isn't apparent on Google Flights or the reservation page, sites like Expert Flyer and Seat Guru aggregate flight information like seat maps and aircraft type.
135	Determining which aircraft models are the safest is less straightforward.
135	The National Transportation Safety Board maintains comprehensive databases of information about accidents and incidents.
135	The Federal Aviation Administration also provides preliminary accident and incident reports, which include the manufacturer of the aircraft involved, from the past 10 days on its Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing page.
136	Another useful resource the FAA links to is the Boeing Worldwide Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents 1959-2022, which assesses plane-type safety by breaking down accidents based on the aircraft model.
136	According to the report, which was published in September 2023, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the aircraft models with the fewest total hull losses, an accident in which the aircraft is destroyed beyond repair.
136	There are a few additional models in the report that have never experienced a hull loss, including the double-decker behemoth Airbus A380.
136	But those models had accumulated fewer than 1 million departures at the time of the report.
137	The report also includes a comparison of hull loss accident rates per million departures, which helps account for the fact that some of the models are more common or have been around longer than others.
137	The Airbus A310, which was introduced in 1983, has the highest rate of hull losses - 2.53 per 1 million departures - among the models that are still in service as passenger aircraft.
137	The Airbus 320 family, which includes the A321 and A319neo, has the lowest rate, at 0.11.
137	The Boeing 737 MAX line, which has been around since 2017, has a rate of 1.48.
138	It's important to keep in mind that, even though these rates are per million departures, some of the plane models in this report - for example, the Boeing 727 introduced in 1964 - have been around for decades and consequently had much longer to accumulate an accident record than others.
139	Perry Cooper, a media representative from the Port of Seattle, which oversees Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, said in an email that there are a wide variety of reasons accidents occur, ranging from equipment to human error.
139	So while it's easy enough to determine what type of plane you'll be on, it's more complicated to determine what that means from a safety perspective.
140	While you can make some comparisons of aircraft models based on the available data, the FAA advises against trying to compare airlines based on their accident records.
140	According to a report cited by the administration, "there currently is no evidence in accident data that would support the ranking of individual airlines based on their safety records."
141	While there are often significant differences between airlines" safety records at any given point in time, this is largely due to the "infrequent but catastrophic nature of an air accident," according to the FAA, and these apparent differences between airlines even out over time.
141	The FAA declined a request for comment.
142	How Betta Edu became a scapegoat of a dysfunctional political system
143	In a recent incident involving Betta Edu, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's administration, there have been calls for her removal from office amid allegations of misappropriation of a N585 million palliative fund.
143	The minister has faced significant public backlash following the exposure of a leaked memo where she purportedly instructed Oluwatoyin Madein, the Accountant-General (AG) of the federation, to transfer N585 million to a private account.
144	As per the leaked memo dated 20 December 2023, Edu directed the Accountant-General to transfer the funds from the account of the National Social Investment Office to the private account of Bridget Oniyelu, the accountant of a Federal Government poverty intervention project called "Grants for Vulnerable Groups," a project under Mrs. Edu's ministry.
145	Speaking on behalf of Edu, Rasheed Zubair, her media aide, asserts that the act is legal within the framework of the Nigerian civil service.
145	However, it is crucial to note that the request violates various sections of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009, which explicitly prohibit fraud and other forms of corruption in government business.
145	Additionally, Chapter Seven, Section 713 of Nigeria's Financial Regulations 2009 explicitly states, "Personal money shall in no circumstances be paid into a government bank account, nor shall any public money be paid into a private account."
145	It further stipulates, "Any officer who pays public money into a private account is deemed to have done so with fraudulent intention."
146	In an interview with Ventures Africa, an anonymous Senior Legal Official from a leading commercial bank commented, "There are several issues concerning this matter.
146	First, her ministry is relatively new, and her predecessor and pioneering minister, Sadiya Umar-Farouk, engaged in activities that appeared to be illegal.
146	It might be a reflection of how they operate in the ministry.
146	Nevertheless, paying public money into private accounts goes against public procurement rules."
146	He added that unless she can provide a valid reason for such approval, it may not necessarily involve fraudulent intent, but it is nonetheless incorrect, and certainty is lacking.
147	In a Twitter post, political and digital communications expert Akin Akinwale expressed the opinion that the ministry might not have been wrong to use a personal account.
148	Expressing a comparable sentiment on her Twitter account, Political Analyst and Development & Management Consultant, Barrister Iyabo Awokoya, conveyed sympathy for the suspended minister.
148	She believed that the minister might have made an innocent mistake driven by a zealous determination to accomplish her job.
149	Based on these expert arguments, it can be inferred that there exists a discord in financial laws between the federal government and other government parastatals.
149	The situation escalated when the leaked document became public, with Betta Edu emerging as a scapegoat for a dysfunctional political system.
150	celeste is my favorite "tiny good freeware game to big bloated commercial game with stupidly detailed art" corruption arc because in the original getting the double dash is a contextless powerup in a treasure chest and in the commercial game it Makes Me Cry
151	In general I really like the interplay between the two games.
151	The advantage of shortform stories is that you can "skip to the good part", they can be more immediately engrossing and satisfying.
151	The advantage of longform stories is that you can imbue whatever happens with way more emotional weight, you lose the immediacy in exchange for stronger payoffs.
152	The climax of Celeste the commercial game is literally just the pico-8 game, blown up, with several hours of mechanical and narrative buildup letting it pop off way way harder.
152	Celeste is so proud of its tiny parent game it throws in references like the memorial, the "2000 M... 2500 M..." progression, the power-up, the flag at the top.
152	It lets you play the original game right from the title screen!
153	Celeste isn't "the good version" or "the finished version" of the pico-8 game, it's just a different approach to the same core story.
153	As someone that loves both shortform and longform stuff, seeing the connection laid bare this way is really interesting and delightful.
154	There's another mid-scale version that could've existed between the two that tells the same expanded resonant story but with a tighter runtime and less insane production values.
154	I think that would've been my favorite incarnation as like, an emotional arc... as is, the main single player arc of the commercial game is ultimately a small piece of it, it's most interested in being a big playground for the world's most loved-on platformer physics. which is still neat, I think.
155	I guess I should find a job, but I'm quite lazy.
155	Hire me now, I'll drink all your beer.
156	not so much lazy, but fatigued, even after all this time.

168	I need to document this crap.
169	@user13 Holy shit, that's delusional
170	@user14 @user13 the eliminating craft bit is incredibly gross, but I can't get over the ‘entertainment just for me' fetish.
171	it makes sense that ai revenge of boardroom derangement has metastasized from all creativity is fungible to there is no value in shared experience
172	it must suck to be these people. i can't imagine how awful their inner life must be
173	@user15 @user14 I feel like "shared experience" is a defining factor of entertainment.
173	Either sharing among an audience or an entertainer sharing with an audience.
173	When you make your own entertainment, just for you, you're just playing with yourself
174	@user13 personally I basically think that shared experience is kind of essential to all we do, other things feel alienated (often, not 100% of course)
175	@user14 yeah, even solitary means are generally for a shared ends.

177	dang... a nationwide AT&T outage. no wonder why things feel dead this morning https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/cell-phone-outage-hits-att-customers-nationwide-verizon-tmobile-users-also-affected
178	it seems like even iMessage over WiFi isn't working, which doesn't quite make sense to me
179	my home internet is also through AT&T and that's fine, thankfully, but now I'm thinking it wasn't so smart to choose the same provider for both internet & phone service
180	the AT&T status site claims there's no outages...even though the news is reporting an outage 😠
181	several hours in, every news outlet is headlining the story, and yet the AT&T status site still claims there’s no outage.
181	Slowest static site i’ve ever used...
182	@user9 I wonder if it has to do with SLAs.
182	If a company is contracted to provide 5 9s or something, can they weasel out of downtime if they claim that it's not yet verified (internally).
182	Like, updating their static status page would be an admission of guilt?
182	Maybe I'm just being paranoid/cynical.
183	@user10 makes sense to me
184	I’ve only ever had one surgery where I needed general anesthesia.
184	It was a “minor” neurosurgery giving my brain more room from a condition I was born with that became symptomatic after having kids (chiari malformation).
184	The moment I woke up has stuck with me, so I relive it a bit when I watch medical shows particularly with a neurosurgeon 😂. Hospital playlist has been on my list for a long time, and I’m really enjoying it right now.
184	#kdrama
185	My surgeon is really thoughtful.
185	He called the day before because snow was forecast, and as the medical team was fussing over me as I was coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room my surgeon noticed I was opening my eyes and the bandage was in my eyes.
185	I mean plus doing the surgery.
185	But still so disorienting.
185	One of the most scary things I’ve done and I was asleep and it felt like no time.
186	I was on my period but I was supposed to strip down.
186	So they let me have these mesh underwear you wear after childbirth.
186	But they strip you completely down in the OR and drape you.
186	So at some point a nice nurse replaced my period care before I woke up.
186	Aside from childbirth where I was conscious and getting help or as a baby, I’ve never had such a private care task done for me.
186	That was also my one stay in the ICU.
186	ICU stay was a precaution for my type of surgery.
187	My surgery involved lots of rest so I watched seasons 1-3 of Grey’s Anatomy.
187	It helped McDreamy was a neurosurgeon.
187	I would pay attention to how the patient was positioned just in the event I could guess what happened to me.
187	Since my surgery in 2018, Hospital Playlist has shown more dramatization of neurosurgery than any other medical show I’ve seen since Grey’s.
187	It is nice to have art and entertainment to help us make sense of our life.
188	@user32 I could perform a liver transplant thanks to Hospital Playlist.
189	@user33 wow!
190	i think a lot about how millennials were the last generation to be able to grow connections with artists without the pressure to impose a critical eye.
191	we came up during a golden age of media, with a collective consciousness around pop culture that no longer exists.
192	we got to jump right into things without having to consider the source, because it wasn't as easy to determine.
193	with no reason to question the pedestal we put them on, those parasocial relationships became prominent building blocks that shaped our lives.
194	this is why we have such strong ties to nostalgia.
195	when The Office was still on the air, my friends and i would order pizza and get together to watch it every thursday.
196	it was unlike anything we have now with streaming, where 12 episodes are dropped at once and everyone watches at their own pace, prefacing social media posts with “spoiler alerts” or keeping discussion in specified silos.
197	we subconsciously crave tapping into the universal community that used to surround it all.
198	it’s why so many of us are still obsessively watching shows like The Office, or movies like Anchorman that provided endless one-line references in a meme-like fashion.
199	we parroted these references back and forth to one another with the assumption that most people would get it.
200	these days, even when something goes viral on a massive scale, we can’t assume everyone has seen it.
201	there is too much to focus on and no way to streamline it … will we ever escape the oversaturation?
202	we get trapped in cycles of discovering new media only to find out the artist is a predator or bigot.
203	we are forced to grapple with holding onto nostalgia while acknowledging that the people who created the art we connected with can be extremely flawed.
204	we step into parasocial relationships more gingerly.
205	we understand that it is hard to get to these positions of wealth and power without stepping on others along the way.
206	in the absence of collective consciousness around media, we developed a level of class consciousness that helps us stay critical.
207	some of us are still putting people on pedestals only to act shocked when they fall.
208	we are in a period of flux and i am anxious to discover where we might settle.
209	@user11 Inclusion and safety should be the default.
210	@user12 @user11 inclusion and safety are always a good thing to prioritize. what default you are referring to?
211	@user11 with the loss of shared experience due to an over saturation of content and the ever increasing polarization of our world, it’s so easy for bad actors to just ruin any chance of us getting together and enjoying things.

234	Very niche issue but it kinda sucks these days that if you're interested in building/customising lil robot figures you HAVE to build something made for war and killing things
235	like back in the 00s you had bionicles, which were essentially adventurers/heroes with elemental powers and actual distinct personalities and hobbies and stuff, but like before and since then its just been stuff like Warhammer, Gundam, Battletech, where everythings geared to being a weapon, showcased to gratuitous effect in accompanying media
236	and sure, these other sources are AWARE that "war is bad", but then you're still selling the killing machines as figures and merch.
236	So, like, what are we doing?
237	I imagine the answer is to just kinda divorce the design from its fictional intent, ppl do that with real world tanks and jets after all, but my brain is having a DIFFICULT time w that
238	Bc the figures do look cool, and I like they way they're constructed, and how the design reflects certain characteristics, but then every set is like "oh by the way here's your laser sword and (at minimum one) gun!"
239	This probably due in no small part to toys oriented to boys having a loooong history of being based on some form of violence, like ur GI Joe's and ur Traansformers, but come onnnnnnnnn its current year

252	* laundry day, I usually wear basketball shorts when I'm just laying around.
253	About to take my Sourdough Starter out of cryogenic stasis*, and get back to baking.
254	*freezer
255	I find it very life affirming; transforming such simple ingredients into something so rich and complex.
255	Like witnessing a birth.
256	@user43 that is a bodacious looking loaf you've birthed there. impressive!
257	@user44
258	I’m trying to goad myself into doing more.
258	But empty nest syndrome has hit me hard.
259	I loved cooking and baking for my posse.
260	@user43 i am genuinely sorry to read that.
260	:(
261	surely, though, you can invite people round to help you devour that beautiful work of bread-y art, no?
262	@user44
263	I’ll keep posting my bakes to my lovely masto-peeps, as they gobble it up.
264	This song is encapsulates my predicament…
265	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxsYTK8l_Gk
266	@user43 shouldn't that be 'i can't get starter'? otherwise, perfect.
266	:D

268	Balance in academia is rare, but time away from the page is when the best thoughts occur.
268	💭
269	Pushing harder to publish more doesn’t always yield better results.
269	It’s important to focus on recovery when striving to be a better scientist.
270	Here are a few ways that I am recharged:
271	Use both sides of the brain.
271	🧠
272	As scientists, we use analytical side of our brain most often.
272	But when using both the creative (i.e., guitar, painting, etc.) and analytical sides of my brain, it feels as though I increased my mental capacity — making me better in both spaces.
273	Training muscles, not just the mind.
273	💪
274	Exercise is not just for those looking to be triathlon athletes or for looking better.
274	It also benefits quality of life—thoughts, moods, productivity—it is all connected.
274	Taking breaks from the desk make time at your desk more productive.
275	Permission to relax.
275	📺
276	Sometimes recharging is not about adding more habits—enjoying a good movie or a fiction book is just as beneficial as creating and physical training.
276	The key is feeling ourselves that it is ok to relax and not do anything.
276	There’s no room for guilt here!
277	These are tactics that I found help me feel recharged, but there are many others.
277	What do you do to stay excited for science and avoid burnout?
277	🤔

279	So, my life kind of sucks right now.
280	And this is why
281	This is the state of my upstairs bathroom right now.
282	My brother came and ripped it all out and I’ve been putting off starting to work to put it all back together
283	Blech.
283	Okay, so I finished pulling the insulation out.
284	Holy crap!
284	The tyvek suit... super good call.
284	Despite getting really hot and sweaty and overall nasty, the state that suit was in afterwards is way better than all that junk being on me.
285	So I guess next is scoring a line on the ceiling and pulling that down then putting the new one up as fast as I can.
286	#DIY #HomeRenovation
287	@user16 Ugh, fiberglass insulation gets everywhere!
287	Great idea, using a painter's suit, I need to remember that!
288	@user17
289	Girl… get one.
290	I think it was 18bucks but looking at what could have been stuck all over me, WELL worth it.
291	And a respirator... use it.
291	For real.
292	I broke the seal on it a few times just moving my face I guess and my nose started running from whatever the heck is floating around up there.
293	@user16
294	I'm a solid proponent of using protective gear!
295	what why are the GPS coordinates getting rounded to the nearest full degree that's absolutely worthless
296	because it's a vector of rational numbers
297	please save me from this horror
298	field 0 is the degree, field 1 is the minute, field 2 is the second
299	i do not like this
300	@user29@user30.engineer oh god, people actually use that outside of trigonometry class???
301	@user31 i never even used it in all of HS trig lmao
302	but yeah it's either DMS or decimal degrees for GPS coordinates most of the time i've found
303	Sally Rooney used to debate, and once you know that it is easy to see those techniques in both her novels and essays.
304	And she is very adept with the English language.
305	That is to say, it is a delight, she employed all of this excellent skill in a service of a larger social point this week.
306	ps - i hope we are past the point of being apologetic about liking her novels or defending them as average.
307	They are so not the books i would have picked up myself, but once i did, it is clear that the craft is definitely beyond reproach.
307	And i do like characters having long conversations, superbly aware of their political roles and yet ignorant to their emotional needs.
307	Part of growing up.
308	Oh right, here is Sally Rooney latest essay
309	https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/2024/03/16/killing-in-gaza-has-been-supported-by-irelands-good-friend-in-the-white-house/
310	@user38 heard this essay was good and it is
311	@user39 i just stumbled upon her essay from a while back about her debating days and let me say, it clearly laid out why i feel apathy towards certain form of podcast that is seen as cornerstone of 'informative discussion'

313	Maybe a fisheye lens is a bit overkill for a nesting box.
314	You live and learn.
315	I probably should've known better since I already built one with a "normal" lens.
316	I'll be posting more about this during the weekend when I get to install the second one I've built.
317	Let's just say the birds will have a better Internet connection than me in 2015.
318	Or at least that is the plan.
319	The box that has already a nest in it is leeching off the wifi in the house.
320	The other one will need some more work to get online.
321	Ok, so during the day I hung up the new nesting box.
321	This is what It looks like in its net place in the garden.
322	But let's rewind a bit.
322	"What's actually in there?"
322	I hear nobody ask.
323	In the top is one of those ESP32 camera boards with a fisheye-lens camera and an IR-LED I stole off a Raspberry Pi camera.
324	The reason for the weird shape of that plastic box is the swiveling side panel of the nesting box.
324	I bought it like that and couldn't modify it so I had to design around it.
325	Since there is no electricity in the garden, the whole thing is powered by a solar panel and a 2600mAh 18650 cell.
326	I didn't photograph the cell or the charger, but here's a picture of the panel.
327	The gray box that hangs on the side of the nesting box is where the battery lives.
328	On a full charge, it gives me a runtime of about 4 hours.
329	I call this a feature.
329	That way the birds get some privacy too.
330	Initially, I wasn't sure if the internet in our garden would be good enough for this setup.
330	The old access points I replaced last year in the fall wouldn't have cut it.
331	But the new ones cover that area just fine.
332	That is almost a bummer because I was planning on mounting a TP-Link cpe210 on the roof and having it point downwards to the garden.
333	I still might do that when/if I set up more camera nesting boxes.
333	Especially in areas further from the house, I might need it.
334	Now, for reasons I'm not sure about yet, the camera is offline.
334	It went out only one hour after sunset.
335	Maybe it stopped charging the battery 3 hours before sunset due to insufficient light.
336	Maybe it couldn't fully charge up in a little less than half a day.
337	I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow.
338	I don't have any telemetry for the battery.
338	This is something I might add in a future revision.
339	A few more sensors in general would be nice I guess.
340	And maybe a battery that's at least on paper capable of running the thing over night.
341	Oh, and a different lens.
342	Fisheye is way overkill.
343	But I'm already browsing Digikey for parts, so I might just build myself a custom PCB for this exact use case.
344	Or not.
344	We'll see.
345	Aaaand it's still offline.
346	Great.
347	According to the proper solar panels on the house the sun is only really up for about 90 minutes.
348	Let's give it another hour or two to see what it does(n't).
349	Still offline.
350	Nothing ever is easy.
351	Turns out the USB-C breakout I was using to plug into the Battery Charger had 5V and GND swapped on the silkscreen.
352	Swapped over the leads and now I've got a charging light.
353	The ESP didn't go online immediately, let's give it a few minutes.
354	One hour later and it's still offline.
355	Looks like it's reboot-looping and triggering Tasmotas reset feature.
356	I guess the panel just sucks ass.
356	I now ordered a bigger one, hoping this does the trick.
357	Look what I found in my Workshop.
358	It's a 24V Panel.
358	Sadly the sun is so low (and partly obstructed by a tree) that it drops down to basically nothing as soon I put a load on it.
359	So I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow to figure out if it actually is enough for this setup or If I need the better panel I ordered.
360	According to Amazon, I bought the panel in 2021 and It should output 12V at a max of 1.2A.
361	So either there's something wrong with this panel or my multimeter, or they changed the listing.
362	Good news everyone!
363	They changed the listing and the one I have is borked.
364	Both the old and the new Listing titles call it a 12V 10W panel.
365	This is why I don't delete old emails.
366	Hey, look: the thing went back online for like half a minute about one hour ago.
367	Maybe the panel trickle-charged the battery just enough for 38 seconds of runtime.
367	It only took a bit over two hours to do that.
368	Guess what: It's cloudy today.
368	So I'm not sure if that (probably broken) solar panel is able to generate enough juice to achieve anything.
369	Let's wait and see.
370	Update: I installed the new panel and now it seems to work.
371	It still might die as soon as the sun goes down, but let's wait and see.
372	Funfact: I'm using the ping integration in Home Assistant to monitor if it's online or not.
373	The average round-trip time is 102 ms.
373	Not great not horrible.
374	I got new stickers.
375	No theyre not for sale, I normally hand them out when at events etc.
376	BUT I was about to place some around Finsbury Park for you to find if you wanted one but it’s too windy and they wouldn’t stay put.
377	Finding an alternative shortly…
378	Free Matt Gray stickers.
379	They’re hiding in big Sainsbury’s at Haringey Green Lanes.
380	If you get there first don’t grab them all leave some for others.
381	Don’t travel too far, someone will beat you to it.
382	If they’re not claimed today I suspect the staff will find them.
383	A couple of extra other stickers I had on me too
384	Let me know if you find them!
385	If you don't happen to be by that random supermarket:
386	If I'm at an event I have them on me.
386	The only upcoming events in my calendar currently are:
387	@user49
388	Superbooth Berlin (just an attendee)
389	If you happen to spot me out and about, feel free to say hi!
390	I sometimes have stickers on me.
391	(Though do mention you recognise me off the internet otherwise I'll be wondering who you are and where I know you from)
392	I'm not selling them because it's not economical.
393	These good quality stickers are about 50p each.
393	They'll cost the same again to post.
393	And way more in my own time to individually package and send them.
394	And I know demand is relatively low, I had a barely-used merch site for several years :D
395	Another one has been found!
396	@user50 Found in the mirror universe?
397	Absolute rocket from from Stroud on a perfect half turn to goal.
397	#DCU #MLS #MastodonFC
398	Really tough not to buy that the league tells officials to help Miami when that’s not a penalty.
398	#DCU #MLS #mastodonfc
399	Probably Pirani's best game this season, but he still just needs to be better.
399	Like the aggressive call to sub him out for an offensive minded player like Fletcher.
399	#DCU #MLS #mastodonfc
400	Amazing how there's two PKs #DCU should have had and got neither.
400	The fix is so in for Miami #MLS #mastodonfc
401	Well, perhaps ball doesn't lie.
401	What an awful give away by Klich.
401	Can't win when your DP plays that sloppy.
401	#DCU #MLS #mastodonfc
402	Absolute meltdown.
402	Obviously, the officiating hamstrung them, but the last twenty minutes are the play of the team that did not deserve to win.
402	#DCU #MLS #mastodonfc
403	Very curious to see how this #DCU team responds to a game that's best forgotten.
403	They've had a bright start and sometimes bad games just happen, but they looked completely outclasses as the game went on.
403	#MLS #mastodonfc
404	@user7 who give a crap, go Badgers Women’s hockey!
404	Hahaha
405	@user8
406	Last free weekend for a while.
407	Next week Saturday: Picocon @ London
408	Easter weekend: Eastercon 2024 at Telford.
409	After that a couple of site visits on Saturdays with a client in Swansea.
410	I better get some motorbikes fixed, or else!
411	Damn this rusty K1100!
411	Is there a single screw which has not seized?!
412	Finally the battery is out.
412	Managed to wiggle it out w/o removing the last screw needed, but that screw will need dealing with.
412	Tomorrow morning's task.
413	Almost there.
413	New one is in place, just need some black isolation tape to be sure.
414	Got some somewhere but exactly where?
415	Heheh not one but three!
416	Success!
416	Last thing remaining is bolting the seat back.
417	Getting my eyes checked, because there was a decent deal for it here, and my left eye’s been weird for some time now, so maybe they can tell me something what’s happening.
418	I’m splurging on a new set of frames, these red ones I reeeeally like.
419	So, apparently the ghost image my left eye sees isn’t too much of a concern.
419	But I need basically varifocals too.
419	So the lenses have a combo of those.
419	Not the full on varifocals but something in between those and ”normal” glasses (no idea of the terminology in English).
420	While this was being told to me, I made a decision to get another pair, and that pair are these.
421	@user36 I like both the glasses you posted, these are a really nice colour...makes me want new ones 😂
422	@user37 My current collection consists of two green pairs, one blue-purple and one pinkish lilac pair.
422	The last one’s at home currently, but I usually carry at least two pairs with me.
423	I’ve been tempted to get sunglasses with prescriptions but they don’t make these for that purpose 😆 I bought the golden aviators on a whim one birthday.
424	@user36 that second pair is really nice!
424	I love buying glasses...I never throw them out but somehow I can't find any of the others?!
424	Mine are rainbow coloured at the moment, I need some sunglasses too... but if you need prescription they're so ugly 😂
425	Running a business as a self-employed introverted creative and having a big heart for privacy shouldn't feel like a twist, but sometimes it is.
425	The majority of online resources and coaches tell you to work with big (and evil) tech using extrovert techniques.
425	Advertise here, follow the algorithm, share your personality.
425	Get a blue tick on that service, be available 24/7, answer inquiries with a video of yourself, respond immediately.
425	Video, video, video.
426	1/3
427	It's a year of transition for me.
428	I don't want to feed Big Tech with money, data and my energy.
428	Or coaches who have their one extroverted solution that they apply to everyone.
428	I'm exploring new ways of doing business, while fighting my long-held belief that you have to do things a certain way to be successful.
429	Wish me luck!
430	First steps are already done.
431	I quit FB, removed all Meta and Pinterest tracker from my website and killed my private WhatsApp account.
432	I also removed the last external tracker, Google Analytics, from my website yesterday and it feels good.
433	I recently subscribed to an European based CRM for better GDPR support and am moving my business over in the next weeks.
434	I transferred my MX to Proton and have now full SPF, DKIM and DMARC without having to pay Google for basic email validation.
435	3/3
436	@user2
437	As a photographer too, I'm really really glad to read your thread !
437	It's mentally not easy to disapear from commercial social medias, I know that.
437	But it will free your mind for so many things 🚀
438	@user3 @user2
439	I'm so to read all this - well done, you!
440	I am about to be in a similar situation.
440	I will need a new website and am making a list of the accessibility and privacy requirements I want (so no Google Analytics, etc.) & investigating how to make using Signal standard for video call; it will mean a lot of client education!
440	- but worth it, I think.
441	@user4 @user3 You can do it!
441	And I would be happy to share my insights with you.
442	Website: take a look at @user5.
442	It seems to be easy, looks great and is opensource.
442	Will switch one of my sites before the next renewal.
443	Signal: Check out cal.com.
443	It's an opensource calendar service with integrations scheduling of video calls with Element call, JITSI, etc.
443	They support Signal as well, but I haven't tested if it's text or video.
444	I can recommend @user6.
444	E2EE, decentralised, open source.
445	@user2 @user3 @user5 @user6
446	Oooh, thank you *so* much!!
446	I really appreciate this!!
446	🙏
447	@user4 @user3 @user5 @user6
448	feel free to reach out if you stumble upon any blocks.
448	Maybe we can solve those together
449	@user2
450	Sure I will !
450	For now I use Nextcloud, for familial or pro it's a good general first step
451	@user4 @user5 @user6
452	A person is here to fix my kitchen floor, so I'm gonna pretend I still have a job and am wfh while editing Too Hot to Handle.
453	If I can get the file to fucking open.
453	(Fuck One Drive.)
454	*hacker voice* I'm in.
455	And this is when he starts drilling Super Loud.
455	Yay.
456	It feels uncomfortably passive aggressive turning up my air purifier to max, but I can smell the wood dust, so it would be justified even if he weren't an anti-masker.
456	And I do actually need to protect myself??
457	I really want to go back to bed, but I can't until he's gone.
458	On the plus side, chapter 4 is finally edited!
459	Chapter five is a long one, but so fucking angsty.
459	Yisssss, the good shit.
460	Doing find and replace on ... ➡️ ellipsis symbol and there are 54 in this chapter 😅
461	But no, I stand by it.
461	Most natural speech is broken up, especially when people get emotional.
462	Floor repair person is doing a vacuum, so hopefully that means he's finishing up.
463	He went outside to (from the sound of things) cut something up.
463	So I sneaked a peak on progress.
463	Still a long way to go :(
464	7 pages left in chapter five.
464	Still my fave chapter and it's in pretty good shape - mostly typesetting changes and very minor edits for active voice and conciseness.
464	But I could really do with a break and a cuppa and the dude is still doing things to my kitchen.
465	He just started vacuuming again.
465	I hope it's a good sign.
466	Kitchen-floor fixer is gone!
467	He told me he did a quote for the whole floor, but the landpeople cheaped out and only paid for the bit by the door where the integrity is gone.
467	It feels a lot better.
468	Not the house is ventilating and my air purifier is running in the kitchen while I enjoy a cuppa in the garden!
469	The best part of Hugging Face’s “The Stack” is that ~the majority of~ many of the repos it lists for me are — and always have been — private repos.
470	Well it looks like I have a GDPR complaint to file
471	Actually now that I’m double-checking several of these repos were deleted… years ago even
472	Like…
473	Either there was a window in time where I had set these public, or something else is happening.
473	Not all of my private repos are in there.
474	@user40 https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@user41/112130028394563476
475	@user42 this is very interesting because it says my latest public post to my-blog was in 2022 but I am certain this repo has been private for several years
476	Just encountered a facial recognition system while boarding an intl flight from Houston's IAH.
476	Apparently it's for some customs-related thing??
477	They said it's not mandatory so I had them pause it and "manually board" me
478	I should add that they said it's not mandatory only once I went up and explicitly asked •_•
479	@user18 what does it check your face against?
480	@user19 I can only assume that it's my visa or passport pic.
480	I should've paid closer attention.
481	It's my first ever crown dentist visit: Prep today, then fitting in a fortnight.
481	I'm practising opening my mouth wide.
482	Well, that was a lot of filing.
483	Stumpy and I are home and feeling better now we’ve had a couple of mugs of tea.
483	Back in a fortnight to get the job finished.
484	Or not.
485	Dentist wasn’t happy with the fit of the crown, even after he’d footered and filed it.
485	So new impressions were taken, and a new crown will be made.
486	Stumpy gets a stay of coronation.
487	And we’re on again.
487	I’ve got a cancellation for tomorrow, so it’s take two on Stumpy’s crowning.
488	Stumpy has been crowned.
488	All hail King Stumpy.
489	@user34 I can almost hear the fanfare.
490	@user35 Honestly didn’t want to get my hopes up after the last time.
491	Now I just have to get used to this strangely smooth tooth so I can stop poking it with my tongue.
492	@user34 I find that irresistible after dental work, takes days for the tongue poking to stop.
493	Yea so I flew this today.
494	first complaint: we need cute logbooks. black is boring, pink is not even pink, it's salmon.
495	I've wanted to fly since I was a child.
496	And it happened today...
496	I flew a plane today.
496	I'm still actually processing that.
497	data from flightaware.
498	Going to try and get out there again this coming Saturday.
498	Weather doesn't look good right now but it's only Monday.
499	So the challenges in this are already showing themselves.
499	I'm likely going to have a VERY difficult time getting a medical clearance due to the FAA's stance on certain medications.
500	Not impossible, but it's going to take a VERY long time and require a LOT of extra work.
501	While disheartening, it's just yet another problem to solve, and it *does* so far seem solvable.
501	Just at great expense of time and $$.
502	In case you're interested in the challenge ahead I face.
503	FAA isn't a fan of ADHD.
503	Definitely won't let you get a medical cert if taking medication for it.
504	https://youtu.be/W5JSfq6LLAU?si=xIxPaY8ayqqNSj4c
505	If I ever have the opportunity to have a custom tail number for an aircraft, you KNOW it has to be some variation of N1337_, the _ being whatever final alphabetical char is available.
506	Of course the sun is gonna be out while I'm away, lol.
506	What a punk.
507	I need to be in the air again.
507	And the weather is not behaving.
508	Welcome to General Aviation 😜
509	I'm getting the vibe that aviation tend to track farily conservative based on some of the ads youtube has decided I should see, videos I'm being recommended, and comments I see.
510	If the weather behaves, I'll be flying again on Saturday.
511	Also, I found a pink logbook.
512	Happy Saturday morning.
512	I did this today ^_^
513	#TeaganAir
514	Its log book official.
514	I have 2.3 hours ^_^
515	#TeaganAir
516	If u asked me to describe what flying a small plane is like, I'd say it's a combination of a motorcycle/ATV and a boat at 4000 ft in the air
517	On the ground things get very fast very quickly.
517	There's a certain Mount of instability on the ground hence motorcycle/atv.
518	Also if you didn't know, you steer a plane on the ground with your feet, not the control yoke.
518	Rudder pedals and brakes.
518	It's not a car.
519	In the air it's bumpy and floaty and feels like you're in a boat on the water.
519	You have control, but sometimes a wave knocks you around a little bit, so u need to get your sea legs except in the air.
520	Oh another random tidbit:
521	Flying is physical.
521	Today I'm *sore* in my back and legs like I went to the gym.
522	This isn't like hopping in the car for a Sunday drive stuff.
522	It's closer to a sport than a cruise in my newly initiated opinion.
523	Happy Saturday lovelies.
523	Welcome to 4000ft.
524	Going back up tomorrow and we're doing stalls and slow flight.
525	Choppy day today, but super fun.
525	We did slow flight and stalls.
525	At one point we had our ground speed down to 16mph with an airspeed of 65.
526	It was a nice clear day, a little hazy at altitude, but nice none the less.
527	FlightAware data track.
528	#TeaganAir #pilot #flying #pa28 #PilotTraining
529	This stuff really is like going to the gym.
529	I ended up taking a 2 hour nap today (just waking up) because I'm physically tired.
529	I'm also rly sore, especially my legs.
529	LOTS of right rudder today.
530	I need a headset.
531	Ah yes, the budget friendly one will do ($699)
532	https://www.sportys.com/lightspeed-sierra-headset.html
533	Ground School off to a good start
534	Yay
535	Another one
536	This one only had 1 question
537	They sure do like to say "May be unrecoverable" as a way to say "This shit will kill you"
538	#spins #stalls #PilotTraining #Flying #TeaganAir #GroundSchool
539	This one was only 2 questions, but I'll take it :)
540	I'm about halfway thru the first study unit
541	For those who are curious, there are 11 study units.
542	#PilotTraining #Flying #TeaganAir #GroundSchool
543	Heck yea, end of study unit 1.
544	I donked up my threading, so this should be part of the mega thread here.

546	Happy Sunday,
547	Today, I completed my first Cross Country Flight (Flight over 50 Nautical Miles).
548	We flew from Mason Mi to Sturgis Mi and back.
549	#PilotTraining #Flying #TeaganAir #PA28 #Pilot #FlightSchool #CrossCountryFlight
550	Sunday Cont.
551	This was flown by hand, no auto pilot involved

553	Sunday Cont:
554	The VFR Chart for the trip
555	Happy Saturday lovelies!
556	Last week the weather didn't cooperate so we're back at it today.
557	Power on Stall recovery, power off stall recovery, slow flight, simulated engine failure(!), pattern work, 3 landings with a little help, and 1 go around.
558	Can't complain about any of that ^_^
559	#TeaganAir #PilotTraining #FlightSchool #Stalls #PA28 #Piper #Flying
560	Saturday Cont:
561	The FlightAware track
562	Lovelies and gentle lovelies,
563	It's been a busy weekend.
564	🚨 breaking news:
565	Teagan landed an airplane all by herself today!
566	Pics are from saturday, ended up with a flat tire after our last landing
567	#TeaganAir #FlightTraining #Flying #PilotTraining #FlightSchool #PA28
568	The flat tire and the nerd girl
569	I’m using tailwind for a project, very begrudgingly
570	seems like learning css would be easier tbh
571	this is just a bit shit
572	i should stop tooting about this tbh but this tailwind component library pointing out how bad the default tailwind setup is is hilarious to me
573	you know what has semantic class names? css and class names
574	don't even need a library for it or anything
575	the jokes write themselves
576	“get simple, semantic classes simply by using these two libraries and a build tool”
577	“brb just updating the padding on paragraphs boss”
578	@user47 noooooOOOOooOoOooooo 🤣
579	What is this, Bootstrap?!
580	@user48 Bootstrap would be sweet relief over tailwind
581	I was pushing for 100k meters this month and I ought to get there.
582	Now I wonder if a million meters in 2024 might be possible?
582	🤔 #peloton
583	🙌
584	Yep, going for the million.
584	You know it's a real goal when there's a spreadsheet to track it.
584	Another month down and I'm still ahead of schedule.
584	#rowing #peloton
585	A quarter of the way through the year update... well ahead of pace!
586	@user20 so every day you row at least 2.8km?
586	Is that on the erg or on the water?
587	@user21 I only row on weekdays, so I average out to a little over 5K/weekday so far.
587	I break it up in different ways.
587	On an ERG.
588	my hedges are getting big.
589	well now they’re god damn huge lol
590	new ath. i know what that means..
591	switch to cash, no more margin.
592	let’s tank the first week of the new year
593	📉
594	lfg $sqqq
595	lfg $tslq lol
596	waaaaahoooo!! lol
597	come on nok, $3.74 let’s go.
598	waahoo x 2
599	when in on $big 4.25-.35
600	i’ll get more too lol
601	yeeee!
602	$sqqq come on. my bag is getting huge lol
603	nothing makes me more happy than elon musk losing money.
603	$tslq
604	i wonder if the twitter would get suspended if i mentioned i had a fat bag of it lol
605	https://www.issmmbeatenyet.com/
606	Apparently there are only two levels that haven't been cleared in the original Super Mario Maker lol
607	Edit: is now down to 1.
607	Just "Trimming The Herbs" left and omg I genuinely don't know if anyone will ever beat it legitimately.
607	It is a ridiculous level.
608	Final edit: that level turned out to be a tool assisted upload, which no one thought was possible at the time but apparently it was!
608	But people still persisted and it got beat in the end! https://fgc.network/objects/0f1b42c6-cbb1-49bb-91f5-db81bc71ea14
609	Been watching some clear attempts and like.. as a person who has played a lot of reasonably hard Mario stuff, everything else aside, grinding Trimming the Herbs (the last level left) looks soul crushing.
610	And it turns out that level was uploaded with a TAS after all, so it is no longer considered to count and they've declared victory.
610	Kinda anticlimactic tbh but GG to the people who got everything to that point!
611	Rip Super Mario Maker 1
612	https://twitter.com/Ahoyoo_Twitch/status/1771286936944099483
613	https://fgc.network/objects/0f1b42c6-cbb1-49bb-91f5-db81bc71ea14
614	And just under the wire basically someone actually beat Trimming the Herbs!
614	Really impressive.
615	@user1 I can't believe the level that was so hard and took so long to complete is only 17 seconds long!
616	alright let's goooo!
617	garlic is doing well (at least the soft neck, the hard neck is a lot scrawnier for some reason)
618	this year's seed order
619	Plougheth mine feeldes
620	tomatoes are all sprouting.
620	I was nervous they would get leggy so bought a $50 set of long grow lights, but I hink I'm doing that Terry Prachet boots thing where I should have just sprung for a real grow light instead of cheap alternatives
621	love to see it!
622	finished putting up rabbit fence.
622	It's sunk 6 inches underground I very much expect it to keep rabbits out
623	moving the best tomato seedlings to bigger containers
624	I hotboxed half my lettuce and arugula to death with a plastic tray cover but other than that seedlings are doing pretty good!
625	going to plant some stuff today
626	there we go - radish, mustard, lettuce, spinach, and bok choi
627	reconditioning all the container soil I used last year and starting my cucurbits.
627	It's half spent potting soil from a friend's weed operation and half topsoil from my folks beds
628	Time to start smashing up our bedroom.
628	Last room in the house that’s had nothing but quick bit of decorating done to it.
629	Remove horrible electric fire and hearth.
629	Box in chimney, replace blown plaster and skim.
629	Build custom wardrobe.
630	We always start with a rough pencil sketch…
631	Got the messy stage out of the way.
632	Found a few dead bird at the back of the flue; very desiccated :(
633	Ready for the plasterer next week
634	Pleased with the little side niche
635	Insert new wardrobe here (not that we have even started on designing this yet 🙈)
636	Ooo, look what we found behind the radiator!
637	And even remembered to add the cute little air vent to keep the chimney from getting damp
638	Sweep has done the capping and cowling.
638	Should be a bit safer for the rooks that like to nest up there 🪺
639	Plasterer has finished.
639	We’ll lay the floor tomorrow!
640	Cork underlay is down, fashioned a toilet-roll sawdust extractor accessory for the hoover 😂
641	Some floor sorted & ready to go down.
641	We’re just having a tea break
642	Boo.
642	Slow progress today due to super awkward cuts around the door jambs to get a seamless transition into the hallway (which is also getting laid).
642	@user45@twitter.com has been cursing me
643	Finished, but broken!
643	The icing on the cake was the terrible assembly instructions for the new bed.
643	We are gonna sleep well tonight!
644	Still to do; hallway floor, all the skirtings.
644	Decorator is coming in a month, so it’s bare plaster chic for us for now
645	Quick bit of evening DIY to tenon saw/chisel out the bottom sections of the door jambs where we want the flooring to fit neatly underneath.
646	Hallway cork underlay is down too
647	We finished the hallway floor yesterday!
647	Then 5am start to collect Thing 1 from Heathrow this morning, then a nap, and final straight for hallway; skirtings on.
647	Will caulk when glue cures
648	Imagine a very long web page with lots of sections (e.g., single-page HTML spec).
648	If the user requests a specific section (e.g. page.html#section7), what if the web server streamed that section first and the other sections after that?
649	Stream order:
650	1. start of HTML document up to <body>
651	2.
651	HTML for section 7
652	3.
652	HTML for section 1, 2, 3, etc.
653	The browser would then make sure to insert the sections 1 to 6 *above* section 7 on the web page.
654	Does this make sense?
654	Would this be useful?
655	What I want to achieve is have the linked section (#section7) render as fast as possible without having to re-implement stuff with JavaScript.
655	I just want to have a super long HTML document but still have linked sections render as fast as possible.
655	It should just work with HTML.
656	The content could be streamed like this, and then the browser would inject each <contents> into its <div>.
657	<div id=sec1></div>
658	<div id=sec2></div>
659	etc.
660	<div id=sec7>section 7…</div>
661	<contents for=sec1>section 1…</contents>
662	<contents for=sec2>section 2…</contents>
663	etc.
664	It would be streamed out of order, but the browser would assemble the HTML document as if it were streamed in order.
665	@user22 You can reorder documents like that without JS even.
665	You can’t use hash part of the URL if you want the server to do something though, but you can use query string search params to let the server know which section you want first.
665	You’ve got a choice for reordering the parts:
666	1.
666	Use CSS
667	2.
667	Use template with slots
668	@user23 Yes.
668	The problem is that the visual order (what the user sees) does not match the DOM order.
668	It may be useful if there existed an HTML feature that would allow streaming out of order, but the browser would then arrange the content in the DOM in order.
669	But the slots approach looks promising.
669	I’ll give it a try.
670	@user22 oh, you want the browser to fix up the DOM order?
671	@user23 Yes, that’s the idea.
671	The section 7 would be streamed first for the sole reason that the user can view it as soon as possible.
671	If that can be made possible without affecting the DOM order, that would be good, so the browser would make sure that the resulting DOM order matches the visual order.
672	In other words, stream section 7 first but make the end result (DOM and visual) be as if all sections streamed in order.
673	@user22 @user23 Have a look at PHOOOS without JS: https://github.com/niutech/phooos
674	trying my hand at miniatures
675	redid the head!
676	been really enjoying kneadatite (green stuff), it's like sculpting with bubble gum but you get used to that and it's tough and flexible when it cures
677	more miniature stuff
678	anatomically accurate green M&M
679	@user26 cheeked up.
679	I love HER*
680	@user27 hehe ty user26
681	Okay, the next video will get roofing contractors mad at me, but it's not for them, it's for you.
681	If you are that person that cannot afford a roofing contractor, then you have to watch this video.
681	This will show you how you can do a cover over an existing old roof yourself.
681	And it's very simple.
681	It's a peel and stick system.
682	Cheers, y'all.
682	Now check it out.
682	I really didn't even eat enough to be wiping my mouth, but I can tell you this, my mouth is salivating.
682	You know what I mean?
682	So look, this is what I'm trying to do.
682	You guys let me know down in the comment section below, what would you do?
682	What type of veggie would you serve this with?
682	And don't forget, this is a budget friendly meal, alright.
682	So let me just go ahead and pour myself a glass of this great coupgate.
682	Yes, sir.
683	Welcome to CSA in Italy.
683	CSA is believed to be an ancient Roman settlement.
683	The site was excavated at least four times over the last century.
683	What is there to excavate if Koa is originally a Roman site?
683	Was the Pantheon in Rome excavated?
683	No, the pantheon is even at the same ground level as the surrounding, contemporary buildings.
683	And why is that?
683	Because the pantheon was probably built during the Roman era, it is also almost cardinally oriented, which indicates that it cannot be very ancient.
684	Venice City on the water.
684	A place of beauty and romance that attracts millions of visitors every year.
684	Just a few steps from the well-trodden tourist routes, there's a very different Venice, one populated by fascinating creatures.
684	This film explores a Venice that few people ever see, a city that has a surprising double life.
685	We're not ready.
685	And it's going to be more dangerous out there because you fired Greg.
685	Because we don't have any money to pay him, Burt, you're doing this, not me. hell I am.
685	Do you not understand what I had to do to get these kids out here?
685	The bond that I had to put up for the insurance company, you want to lose all that?
685	Rather than risk hurting one of the kids?
685	Yeah.
685	Why?
685	Never bothered you before.
686	Now I need to quickly mention the reactor's name, as it was considered a zero power installation.
686	You see, a zero power nuclear reactor is capable of sustaining a stable fission chain reaction, with no significant increase or decline in the reaction rate.
686	This type of installation is essential to gain practical experience of reactor operation, but can still be deadly if the delicate balance isn't maintained.
687	This is a super, super easy project, surprisingly.
687	Like, it's not hard to match things up.
687	So that's the nice thing about this project.
687	Okay, so that's down, right.
687	So now I'm going to start this way.
687	I'm just going to run the glue all the way around and do one side at a time.
687	So here we go.
687	I'm running it right above the tin, the rim, rim, the rim tin.
687	Jeez.
687	So I'm just going to take this and move it along.
688	This is an authentic and real old footage, of a true certain giant individual from Japan, walking in some military parade.
688	What's shocking about it, is his actual size.
688	He has a statue of at least 4 meters high, which is minimum 13 feet.
688	Thus, he is genuinely taller, and more massive than each and every other NBA player, for example, like Shaquille O'Neill, or Yao Ming.
689	I encourage them to challenge their teachers even when they think the teacher is wrong about something.
689	I think that it's a good thing for people to go out there and not just accept everything as it is.
689	So that kind of famously as a Congressman explained to all of your votes on Facebook, which is a rare concession by authority to say, okay, this is why I did what I did.
689	Yeah, and actually, you know, a lot of the people in leadership and in Congress didn't like that I was doing that because I was giving people at home the power to challenge them.
690	The question is, like countless other claimed Neolithic ruins, how did they achieve such feats?
690	How did they lift such enormous stones?
690	Were they, like we have posited many times before, the remnants of a once advanced yet destroyed ancient civilization, we find such possibilities, in particular, the men here of Agra, highly compelling.
691	So I bought an Xbox Series X so that you don't have to.
691	Or maybe you actually have to.
691	In this video, I'm going to tell you all the pros and cons of choosing an Xbox Series X. I'm also going to go over the actual hardware, the controller, the games just about everything that is my experience so far with the Xbox Series X. So I hope you will enjoy this video, and maybe even find it useful.
692	I'm sure marine dinosaurs still exist.
692	My apologies for intruding upon your thoughts, Madame Roseau.
692	But strictly speaking, only reptiles that walked on dry land are called dinosaurs.
692	If they lived under the water, they are called marine reptiles, and they all disappeared a very.
692	Very long time ago.
692	What happened?
692	You'll see, Julie.
693	So once all that is done, I wipe away all the excess powder with a little bit of alcohol and a paper towel.
693	Super easy to clean, and then I apply my cuticle oil.
693	This is actually face oil from T, but I didn't like how it was so stinky.
693	I didn't want to put it on my face, so I use it as a cuticle oil.
693	And this is the final product of my nails.
693	I love them and I'm obsessed.
693	A couple of frequently asked questions.
693	How long does my nails last.
693	I usually leave my nails on for two weeks.
693	Sometimes I take them off early because y'all know I do my own hair, and I gotta have my libs when I do my hair, because it's easy to grip.
694	Knight of the Galactic Railroad by Kenji Miyazawa.
694	This is a Japanese story of two young boys who embark on a mystical journey on a celestial train, going through the galaxy, encountering various allegorical experiences and deep philosophical themes.
694	As they navigate the night sky, the story reflects on life, death, and the human condition, leaving readers with a profound exploration of existence and the universe.
694	The novel was adapted into a manga in 1983, and an anime in 1985.
695	Where I'm standing would have been the bottom of the Western Interior Sea, about 85 million years ago.
695	Mike Everhard is one of the world's leading experts on Mosesaus.
695	The horizon would have been ocean for as far as you could see, that the seaway stretched for hundreds of miles from where we're standing.
695	At this time, the climate is warmer, so there are no polar ice caps.
696	All right, well, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it down to a small riot, would you?
696	Danny, when are we going to be able to afford a larger car?
696	When you're about 10 years older and can marry a millionaire.
696	I had more room than my baby bug.
696	Yeah, I haven't finished paying for that either.
696	In fact, I still owe two more payments to the hospital before I own you.
697	Today we're going to talk about Ben Affleck defending an interview.
697	Greg, why don't you to tell us about the video we're going to watch.
697	Yeah, so a couple of weeks ago, Ben Affleck went on a two hour interview with Howard Stern.
697	He talked about his breakup with his ex- wife and family, and he had some fallout from it, so here we go.
697	Here he is, Ben no Flick.
698	Now I need to let y'all know I have, I've never done this before, but I'm going to do it now.
698	Skin potion is handcrafted with organic and all natural ingredients that deeply moisturize and illuminate the skin.
698	Veil of Venus is the newest addition to the Skin Potion family.
698	It is available right now for pre order.
698	And you can follow Skin Potion on Instagram @kpotionus that's S K I N O T I O N Skin potion or Skin potion us and visit their website, www.shopskin potion .
699	So I had been working with music for over 20 years and released two album during that time, and touring around Germany and Poland and Sweden, of course.
699	So you've always been a performer from a very young age?
699	Yeah, I have.
699	And is there any iconic places that you performed at when you were younger?
700	And now you see that whatever happens backstage, it doesn't matter because the show will go on.
700	And I got a comment from Lovely Lich that you really like the video.
700	And she writes, I like the behind the scenes things, like traveling to the fish, the atmosphere there, the food and stuff a day in your life, so to speak.
700	So I hope you liked this video and we'll show you as much as possible.
700	So now it's time for lunch, and Deep is making some scrambled eggs.
700	And the trick here is to add an extra egg yolk to it.
701	The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
701	Disagree.
701	If the enemy of your enemy were your friend, he'd explicitly be your friend.
701	You know, oftentimes people can work together for a time, united by their dislike for something or someone.
701	But if that relationship was conceived by your mutual dislike for whatever that thing is, what's to stop that relationship from dissolving or becoming hostile after that thing is taken care of.
701	Like the foundation of a friendship is much more stable than that.
701	But you know, I also understand the short term strategy behind it, so I'll just disagree.
702	A long time ago, their parents were killed by poachers and Cheyenne and Kuyu were sold at the market.
702	Taken in by the Help Congo organization, they grew up in semi- captivity with about 30 other orphans out on the islands.
702	One after another, these young chimpanzees have been shown the way back to the forest.
702	The association scientists have given them each a name to identify them.
703	And because of that, you cannot trust any media outlet to report on the news fairly or accurately.
703	Now that being said, I still think there's some value to the mainstream media.
703	Just because they are exaggerated and biased, doesn't mean they can't be trusted at all.
703	There's still a lot of useful information you can gather from these sources.
703	You just have to know how to analyze them properly.
703	The same is not necessarily true for the alternative media, the smaller companies or even individuals who talk about the news on sites like YouTube and Facebook.
704	And when you download it, it should be a pretty quick, small file size.
704	You're going to get an app that looks just like this.
704	So I could click on that right now.
704	And this is the view that you're going to see right away here.
704	And so I'll talk about a few things with the lab.
704	Now one thing to note is that the lab instructions for the lab worksheet that you're going to work on are pretty self explanatory.
704	So really, the purpose of this video is to show you how to use the app itself.
705	Well, it still sounds better than Pink Floyd, so in Manic Miner, you collect all the items on the screen and head to the goal.
705	And you gotta do it before you run out of air or hit something.
705	Hit what exactly?
705	Weeds!
705	You can die from touching grass.
705	It sounds like half my fanbase.
705	And did you notice I died from touching a weed that was on a completely different platform?
705	I just went through the platform and then hit the weed.
705	That's good game design, man.
705	And then there's this asshole over here who's gone.
706	Alexa play, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to.
706	Whoa, whoa, we gotta spit that out.
706	Alexa play, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to.
706	You cry too if it happened to you.
706	Woo!
706	Alexa, Midnight!!!
707	Hi Rob.
707	Hi Marion, how are you?
707	I am very well.
707	Why are you dressed as a security guard rob?
707	Management have asked me to create a new healthcare security news section and buyer's guide and I thought a costume may help me get into character.
707	Oh, I see.
707	Yes, well maybe it will rub.
707	We have a news section now that looks at the issues and opportunities surrounding data security and network security and healthcare.
708	Hello, it's Bayano with Bayano Reno.
708	We're going to prepare some grout.
708	The tars looks to be about 14, 15 years old.
708	We're going to do it just to stabilize the tales because the way it is, the tars looks good.
708	It's just losing up in some area.
708	We don't want to play the whole tile grout.
708	We're just going to do some repair to last until we are ready to do a full renovation.
708	Yes is this a recording?
709	So my dad can't give me rides to work.
709	And for me, work is about 27 miles away.
709	So there and back would be nearly a hundred dollars a day with Uber.
709	I haven't looked at Lyft.
709	I could have, I guess, that makes sense.
709	But I didn't have rental on my auto insurance, so that's my fault.
709	So I guess I could have tried to do that and get that set up and tried to get a rental while I was down and out of a car.
709	But even then, a rental would cover seven days.
709	I'm going to sneeze, hold on.
709	That sneeze sucked.
710	Now talking about stars, Howard Jones appears as a special guest vocalist in a duet with you on the album.
710	On the track, I Made a Case, who has offered you so much encouragement with your music.
710	Was it by chance that he happened to appear on the track?
710	As I hear you had to strip back the track as didn't want anything being in the way of your voices telling the story.
711	Water.
711	The liquid that oceans are made of.
711	And it fills endless depths.
711	Only a few will venture out into the endless open ocean of this vast underwater world.
711	Most of the ocean inhabitants live in the city as it were, like human societies.
712	Well, you'd only have the law on you and bring it back, and then things will be worse than ever.
712	Maybe so.
712	It just ain't no sense in leaving.
712	We ain't got a chance.
712	Wait, Chris, what a thing to say.
712	We've all got a chance.
712	The world's full of beautiful things.
712	Not for us, swampers.
712	Yes sir, for all of us.
713	Hey Psychtogoers, and welcome back to our channel.
713	Thank you so much for all the love you've given us.
713	Your ongoing support has helped us make psychology and mental health more accessible to everyone.
713	Now let's continue.
713	We've all done something self- destructive at some point in our lives.
713	Most of the time, it's not intentional and doesn't become a habit.
713	Self destructive behaviors are those that are bound to harm you physically or mentally.
713	It may be unintentional, or you may know exactly what you're doing, but the urge is too strong to control.
713	Problems can arise when this type of behavior becomes habitual.
713	So here are seven common behaviors of a destructive person.
714	Starr.
714	The princess of Tamara.
714	Comfortable, I hope.
714	More bag rock! Oh!
714	Such a formidable spirit.
714	Your sister was wise to hand you over.
714	Galar neck!
715	We must recognize that the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United States have had great differences.
715	We will have differences in the future.
715	But what we must do is to find a way to see that we can have differences without being enemies in war.
716	How did you very early on, considered or realized that, well, engineering, is just part of the challenge, especially that we're taught as engineers that we're dealing with issues, right?
716	And we're finding solutions.
716	That's our job.
716	How did you came across that so early on?
716	Well, it was a strange coincidence, so to speak.
716	Of course, I grew up in the 1970s.
716	I gained my political consciousness, as well as my academic understanding in the 1970s and that context matters, of course, massively.
717	South Wales Four Piece.
717	The Now are proud to release their debut album Too Hot To Handle via True Music, and Callum joins me now.
717	How are you doing, Callum?
717	How's it going?
717	Yeah, all good.
717	Good yourself.
717	Yes, I'm very good.
717	Thank you.
717	It's a privilege to speak to yourselves because I've been listening to your music quite a lot and since 2023.
717	So I'm just loving the music, and I think it's something that would definitely need in the charts these days.
718	So when did you first start writing and performing music after having your stage in front of your grandparents there?
718	Well, basically, more performing.
718	I did a bit of writing, but I left it to professionals.
718	You know, when I was recording with professional writers and big, big hits around the world.
719	Proper handling and disposal of waste at your auto repair facility is important for employee health, but also to avoid fines or significant legal settlements.
719	Also, customers want to do business with companies that make an effort to proactively protect the environment and operate in a sustainable way.
719	So what are seven ways you can do this?
719	Number one, re-refining used oil.
719	Don't just discard your old oil.
719	With the right processes, oil can be fully re-refined and reused indefinitely without any reduction in quality.
720	Check.
720	Check.
720	Rock the scissors, scissor defeats paper, and paper defeat Rock.
720	You win.
720	The loser will lose one star.
720	At the end of each game, the referee will put the cards back into the recycling box.
720	Of course, if both players choose the same guard, the game is tied, and no one will lose a star.
721	Hello this is Nick from Review Outlaw.
721	So what we're going to do today is to do a final walkthrough of the cabin we finished up.
721	Pretty much getting to the end.
721	This is the first room you walked into before you can finish, we finished that ceiling, got the walls all sheet rock painted this little border across here, got alarm system in.
722	Hello world PDR coming at you here with a 2018 brand new Yukon Denali.
722	It's got a little dent right here in the back quarter.
722	I've got it not super warm.
722	I've got it 95, that's maybe a little too warm.
722	I'm going to turn this down.
722	We're just going to do a quick little glue.
722	I've got the glue all hot and ready.
722	Can you guys see where that dent is, I'm just going to drop it right in there and then maybe even remove the heat.
723	Take a close look at this bolt.
723	It has some surface rust on it, but it's still useful.
723	We're going to show you how we managed to play ordinary hardware with a zinc finish.
723	If you always have the materials on hand at home, you can save yourself a little money and a trip to the hardware store whenever you need zinc plate and hardware.
723	We're going to show you everything you need to have on hand to zinc plate and weatherproof this bolt.
724	And he said, " You have a tattoo."
724	And I said, I have a few on your hand, I have a banjo, and I told him about it, as a friend of mine, Darryl Adams said he said I had to.
724	Oh yeah, there's a banjo right there on your hand.
724	Can we see it?
724	Look, there's a banjo.
724	It's the kind of tattoo you should really get on your knee, you know?
724	Or a banjo on my knee?
724	Oh, banjo on my knee?
724	Yeah.
725	Here's the full story of Danny and Sam.
725	Ready?
725	Ready.
725	Danny Fenton and Sam Manson are best friends, and along with Tucker, they spend pretty much all their time together.
725	Sam's the reason Danny has ghost powers in the first place.
725	Come on, Danny, a ghost zone.
725	You gotta check it out.
725	You know what?
725	You're right.
726	Nearby Basil was awoken by an emergency alert as a Faustmanning gas cloud from the blaze was spread across the area.
726	Locals were told not to leave their homes and to close all windows and doors, although this alert was lifted around 7 AM when the smoke was thought to be non fatal.
726	It wouldn't be the air so much as the water that would be heavily polluted, and it would be the very water used to douse the flames that would caused the disaster.
726	The highly toxic mercury compounds were present as fungicides in sea dressings in the warehouse, and were marked with fluorescent red dye Rhodamine B.
727	Crime Fighters 1.2747.
727	Jump City is a cesspool.
727	I can't bring justice to the streets alone.
727	I need a sidekick, preferably several sidekicks.
727	I'll call them teammates to be polite, but everyone will know their sidekicks.
727	Networking apps.
727	Welcome, Rob Dog 747.
727	Let's put together a team.
727	Team assemble mode.
727	Not older than me.
728	Kim Jong-il said to the officials I shared a great leader's motor, served the working messes and let flowers bloom even on a rock, if this is the people's desire.
728	This is my alpha and omega.
728	This idea has been embedded in every aspect of the people's living in the solution of traffic problem for one thing.
729	First of all, what we're going to do is just mix this paint up.
729	It mixes one to one with a producer and we just mix it up like we normally would painting anything.
729	So I have two ounces of paint here, so I'm going to put two ounces of reducer.
729	We're going to start up.
729	Now it's ready to put in the gut and spray.
730	This is aluminum, aluminum for our industries and aluminum for our homes, aluminum for building, for transportation, for communication, for agriculture, and for national defense.
730	What is it that has made aluminum, one of the youngest members in the family of metals, such an outstanding material?
730	The answer lies in its amazing versatility and unusual combination of properties.
730	Its smart, modern appearance in a variety of natural or colored finishes.
730	Its great strength, combined with extreme lightweight, and outstanding advantage in almost every metal application.
731	Initial applications to Harvard for a psychology masters were rejected, but was eventually admitted.
731	The initial setbacks were due to Milgramm not taking any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College.
731	In 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology.
731	He became an assistant professor at Yale around the same time.
732	I didn't say that.
732	You don't have to.
732	You know better than anyone that violence begets violence every time.
732	The council made the decision.
732	The council is gone.
732	We spend our entire lives.
732	Entire millennia devoted to protecting life.
733	And there's just something that you folks a serious sense of all.
733	And that's what I want to try to convey to you guys tonight.
733	So I hope you're ready for a nice relaxing journey through some of the deeper history of ancient Egypt.
734	If you're going to use tar to seal, it will crack.
734	Let me show you.
734	I'm removing the silicon, which is one of the no-nos to silicon sealer.
734	But then, somebody put tar here and they paint it over the towel.
734	Let me show you.
734	What did that do?
734	It's just a filler.
735	For a man, I feel more sorry for him than her, somehow.
735	There's nothing can be done about it.
735	The Dors had another sinking spell.
735	The hospital doesn't think she'll last the day.
735	It must be unbearable.
735	I've never lost anyone.
735	You get over it.
735	Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Leslie.
735	Oh, that's all right, Ms. Roe.
735	You get over it.
735	Eventually.
736	603 right now on this Wednesday morning, and we are following a tragic story this morning.
736	A teenager is dead after police found her body in an eastside ditch.
736	The gruesome discovery was made hours after her parents reported her missing, saying she had left on a walk last night.
736	News For Tony Davis is live this morning with more on the circumstances that may have led to her death in the police investigation.
736	Good morning, Tony.
737	It's been months, and I feel like I'm still standing there at his grave.
737	I can't leave him.
737	He's gone, and I still can't leave him.
737	I see in every uniformed soldier I pass, and they're everywhere since the bombing.
738	Okay I died.
738	There was some light there when I was panning.
738	Yeah, that's what made me miss the shot.
738	My ping is fine.
738	Anyways yeah you can see what I mean by the frame rate.
738	That's what I really don't like about this device.
738	It can't keep up with the game, basically.
738	So when I was shooting him, basically I was shooting at all the wrong places, not because of my ping, but it's because of the graphics lagging, basically.
738	All right, so let's head over to COD Mobile.
739	What did you get?
739	Like how did it apply to your own life?
739	Well, at the end of the day, they all ask God for forgiveness.
739	All of them.
739	So when you're reading all these books about all these conquerors, when you're a young man and you're on your way to becoming the youngest ever heavyweight champion, and you're trying to take on the mindset of the conkers and you find out they all has God for forgiveness.
739	How did that affect you?
739	That was pretty cool, because by that, I learned greatness was the willingness to die.
740	Hello everyone!
740	If you don't know me, my name is Janika and I am an expert from Finland, living in the Netherlands.
740	Welcome to this vlog.
740	Today we are in the city of Harlem.
740	Harlem is a really lovely city located in the province of North Holland.
741	I know that a lot of you have been having some fun with my advancing years.
741	You've even tied my recent surgery to my age.
741	Well, I got to be honest with you.
741	I had that same operation when I was young, and it felt so good.
741	I wanted to have it done again before I was to.
741	But I am aware of my age.
741	When I go in for a physical, now they no longer ask me how old I am.
741	They just carbon date me.
742	Battery is good.
742	Now we can see this IC is dislocated from the PCB.
742	We can see the condition of this IC.
742	Now this track is coming here.
742	This track is damaged.
743	With his general purpose military markings, the Guinean pufferfish doesn't mind being seen.
743	The Atlantic lizardfish doesn't bother with disguises at all.
743	It simply shimmies into the sand.
743	This may fool both its prey and its predators.
743	But it won't fool the pufferfish patrol.
744	I like to wear gloves just because stainless edges are usually pretty sharp, like a razor, so you don't want to cut yourself up while you're trying to straighten it.
744	I like to use the table as a dolly a lot of the time.
744	They do also offer specialty trim or jeweler's hammers is what they're sometimes called.
744	Also trim angles.
744	But in this case, since it's a large flat piece, I'm just going to go ahead and use my standalone auto body hammer.
745	Today we're making some beautiful vintage Easter craft.
745	Keep watching!
745	I'm Brandy and this is Making it my own DIY.
745	Welcome!
745	The first project are going to be two Easter ornaments.
745	I'm going to start off with two little ornaments here and you can use whatever you have on hand.
745	I've got these little decor eggs from Dollar Tree.
746	The king, Labella, is said to have travelled the 1,600 miles to Jerusalem.
746	Legend has it, when he returned and Jerusalem fell to the Islamic conquest, Lalabella ordered a new home for Christianity.
746	Each church was carved from a single piece of rock to symbolize spirituality and humility.
746	The Christian faith inspired many features receiving biblical names, even Lalabella's river is known as the River Jordan.
746	Lalabella remained the capital of Ethiopia from the late 12th to the 13th century.
747	On Mars, which is a planet half the size of the Earth, there was a lot of water on Mars a long time ago.
747	To do that, there's a volcano on Mars, 81,000 feet tall, almost three times taller than Everest.
747	So what's happened over the great span of time is more than really my imagination can grasp.
747	So knowing how first water, first life, 3.7 billion years, we'll just say life.
747	So, you know, pretty, pretty early in the early evolution of the earth.
748	Sasebo Festival is a biannual, cultural, political, and artistic event forum conference that brings together quite a lot of different formats.
748	We've been doing this now as a European alternative, the organization behind this for 10 years.
748	So we have quite a bit of experience at the same time, it's an event that is nomadic, so it always takes place in a different city.
748	The last time, two years ago, we were in Belgrade in a city outside of the European Union.
748	This year, in 2017, we wanted to come to Madrid for quite a lot of different reasons.
749	The Islamic Movement in Nigeria has described the freedom granted its leader Elzakzaki and his wife, as victory over persecution by President Mohammad Buhari and Governor Nacional Erofei of Kaduna State.

751	The documentary film you are about to see, was shown to Mr. Alexander Kerensky, president of the Democratic Provisional Government of Russia, overthrown by the Communists in 1917.
751	Mr. Kransky consented to make a few introductory remarks about our picture.
751	We present 80 year old Alexander Kerensky in his New York City apartment on October 10th, 1962.
752	Your Honor, my client accepts the jury as presently constituted.
752	The jury is satisfactory to both sides.
752	We accept the jury.
752	The jury is satisfied to us.
752	I swear the jury.
753	Kid Durango of Arizona, the Dust Devils.
753	The layer of dew that covered the prairie, disappeared quickly as the sun rose over the foothills.
753	The moon hung around for a while, and then sunk far below the ranges.
753	The day began like a thousand other Arizona days.
753	That was until the cloud came.
754	And I have a lot of experience.
754	I've worked internationally.
754	I've worked this continent.
754	I've worked at different states, different market segments.
754	And what I found is people are really intrigued by that.
754	They want to know kind of what the behind the scenes is.
754	So some of these videos are going to be tips from somebody that actually works in this industry and I think that's what separates me a little bit from possibly other travel bloggers that you might follow.
754	You know, I may not have worked for, say, even in the cruise industry, but I had to take courses in it for my hospitality degree.
754	So even if I haven't worked in it, I've been educated on it.
755	You're a jerk.
755	Look, Celia, we have to follow our passions.
755	You have your robotics and I just want to be awesome in space.
755	Why don't you just tell me that you're freaked out by my robot hand?
755	I'm not freaked out by it's...
755	All right, fine.
755	I'm freaked out.
755	I'm having nightmares that I'm being chased by this giant, robotic. done!
756	Hello.
756	How about that Albany calls?
756	Busy?
756	We'll call the chief operator, tell her to keep the line open.
756	Official business.
756	It's a matter of life and death.
756	I hope you are telling me the truth, Mrs. Kennedy.
756	It won't go well with you if you're not.
756	I tell you what I told you the truth.
756	Dirk and Grab, told my drift.
756	He struggled.
757	Okay, so this final repair is spine repair.
757	Spine repair, it's a little bit more complicated.
757	There are more steps to it, but if you follow along with me, I think you can easily do it.
757	So what I'm going to do first for the spine repair is I need to remove this old spine.
757	So hopefully I can save this label and I can reattach it to the new material that we put over the spine.
757	That way I don't have to worry about creating a paper label or going without a label.
757	So I'll cut this part off first and I'll show you how to clean that up later.
758	Welcome.
758	Welcome, everyone.
758	I'm just going to make sure that all of this is working.
758	It just takes a minute.
758	So I came on a bit early just to make sure, just washed my hands and getting ready to go.
758	So I'm just finishing setting up.
758	I think we're good.
758	I'm going to make mistakes so I can feel it.
758	It's one of those days.
758	So I'll just wait until people get on and then we'll get started.
759	Mom says you don't want to visit us.
759	She says that.
759	Yeah.
759	Everybody's got a story, son.
759	I guess that's hers.
759	Life's funny that way, you know.
760	More than 4.5 billion years ago, the Milky Way galaxy collided with a nearby dwarf galaxy.
760	This encounter hastened the formation of stars.
760	Our solar system is a part of the Milky Way Galaxy.
760	Within the Solar System, material circulation had been progressing.
761	Oh my god, you guys, listen, I'm so excited because this comedy special is about 23 years in the making, okay?
761	Yeah, I'll tell you what, what I mean by that.
761	23 years ago is when I first came to the comedy store and became a regular and became a comedian and disappointed my Iranian immigrant parents.
762	About 450 million years ago, plants took a giant leap out of the oceans onto the land to become the plants that we know and love today.
762	But how did they survive?
762	Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out.
762	Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil.
762	They do this by forming a special friendship with soil dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza.
762	These strands of mycorrhiza reached deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants.
762	But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?
763	It seems that as we suspected, the evidence is mounting to support the far more logical claim that an advanced lost civilization's heritage has been stolen by different, more modern civilization all over the world.
763	A great civilization did once flourish here on earth, one which has been actively suppressed, stolen from, exploited, and hidden for far too long.
763	Thanks for watching guys, and until next time, take care.
764	I'll never be a superhero.
764	You have the power.
764	The problem is you have so much that you can control it.
764	I know who can help us train better.
764	Of course!
764	We'll start with virtual training.
764	This we are super realistic.
764	We were just walking by and we thought, hey, let's test out the new little weakling.
765	Hello and welcome to this travel vlog.
765	Today we are exploring the city of Rotterdam.
765	Rotterdam is a city located in the province of South Holland.
765	It is a city that divides opinions because of its more modern and urban- looking architecture.
765	Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed during World War II when the Germans attacked the city.
765	Because of this, the city had to be rebuilt, resulting it to look quite different from the other cities in the Netherlands.
766	Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA.
766	So this is the Nagle crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA.
766	And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions.
766	You have to just screw all of the elements together.
766	And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate.
766	Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well.
766	They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just e 6,000 these down.
766	You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to.
766	And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand.
767	What's up guys?
767	Zach here with Better in Construction.
767	For a lot of you, this is your first time on the roofing side of YouTube.
767	So I want to welcome you guys personally by making a video that's very important to me.
767	The subject of this video is, if I was to do this roof, and I've never shingled before, how would I do it?
767	Knowing everything that I know now.
767	So this is a video that's going to help DIYers or new shinglers not make mistakes and take the proper precautions to get this job done right without wasting time.
767	So first things first, we need to familiarize ourselves with this material.
768	While the rescue force patrols the city, we'll take care of watching over the museum in the box.
768	It wouldn't be a good idea for the villains to try and steal the cabbonita with us waiting inside.
768	We've run out of money!
768	We'll have to steal that diamond and sell it!
768	Otherwise, we'll have to do our experiments with solar pap.
768	How are we going to get the bots inside?
768	It's all taken care of.
769	The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a monument dedicated to servicemen who gave everything in defense of our country.
769	Located in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, and attracting millions of visitors each year, the tomb of the unknown soldier stands proudly protected by tomb sentinels.
769	The soldiers of the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment, the Old Guard, took over the right to guard the tomb in April of 1948 and continued to carry on this sacred duty.
769	The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier has been guarded 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, for the past 77 years.
770	Time for the Scotty Kilmer town.
770	Does your car have faded paint on it?
770	Just stay tuned, because today I'm going to show you how to polish off faded paint.
770	And all the text is a bucket of water, a polisher, and a bottle of this, McGuire is the ultimate compound.
771	Hook the vacuum up to it, it helps keep the dust down and you can prep your concrete that way also.
771	We prefer to do it with the hand grinders ourselves, so either way will work pretty good.
771	Usually if it's got an epoxy coating already, the hand grinders work a little better, but this thing looks really good too.
771	So after we do that, we fix all the cracks, fix all the divots with our patch repair material and then we grind them smooth, and then we clean the concrete and get it ready for the first coating.
771	This is going to be a 100 % solids epoxy so it goes on and it's different procedures, different stages.
772	The Zoroastrian text, Veda, states that Yema built an underground city on the orders of the god Arua Mazda, to protect his people from a catastrophic winner.
772	Much like the account of Noah in the Bible, Yima was instructed to collect pairs of the best animals and people as well as the best seeds in order to reseed the earth after the winter cataclysm.
772	This was before the last Ice Age, 110,000 years ago.
773	Okay, so let me explain.
773	All right, so the problem is, if you look inside there, you see the wood siding, there's the old siding, and it buzz up to the shingles there.
773	And then I put this over it.
773	And what happens is the dirt collects there to that flashing.
774	Hey guys, Thunder E here and welcome to the video you've been waiting for.
774	I am talking about gaming on the SUS ROG Phone 5.
774	Now, the ROG Phone series is well known for its gaming pils, but in this video, we're going to find out if the ROG Phone 5 is truly taking back the crown as the king of gaming.
775	It is December 1997, and the Imperial Sugar Company is acquiring a new production site at Port Wentworth, from Savannah Foods and Industries Incorporated.
775	There is nothing really of note here, it was doing what businesses do, and that is acquiring to expand.
775	The site has been home to food production and processing since the early 1900s.
775	Savannah Industries Incorporated, began construction of granulated sugar production facilities at Port Wentworth during the 1910s, completing it in 1917.
776	The next 85 South Show.
776	He needs no introduction.
776	Where my man is done.
776	We're gonna give him an introduction anyway.
776	He's not an Atlanta, by way of Mississippi.
776	You might have seen him on MTV walling out.
776	Lady, he is the coldest in the game right now.
776	Your baby daddy, Carlos Millers in the building.
777	We're just going to let that sit and rehydrate for a couple of minutes.
777	With ultralight cooking, we're not actually cooking on this dough.
777	We're primarily boiling water so that we can rehydrate our food.
777	It's also one of the reasons why we use instant grits.
777	less cooking time, less fuel and less weight.
777	Oh yeah.
777	So this is about what we've got going on here.
777	Perfect consistency.
778	The thick cloud cover prevented sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth.
778	The Earth underwent a global glaciation event, known as the Snowball Earth.
778	This caused another global mass extinction.
778	But once again, some life survived yet another difficult period, beneath the ice sheet.
779	Come on City is the city of heroes.
779	The Super Thing and the Kazoom kids fight with their powers derived from Kazoom itself.
779	It's the most potent energy source ever known, and now it's on display at the City Museum for all to admire.
779	And we're going to steal it?
779	Isn't it dangerous to slip through here?
779	Negative.
779	This is the way the kazoos are coming.
780	With digital tools, it is easier than ever to create, edit, and publish your work to the world.
780	But there's a cost.
780	It's also easier than ever to spread misinformation, and fake news has become a real issue in recent times.
780	We see this with students.
780	According to a Stanford study, only 25 % of high school students were able to identify an accurate news story compared to a fake one.
780	Students also had a hard time distinguishing between real and fake photographs as well as authentic and staged videos.
781	Thirty million years ago, a monster roamed the landscape.
781	While we're talking about one of the most ferocious animals that probably ever walked the earth.
781	This was the biggest beast to live in North America since the dinosaurs.
781	Look at the size of that skull.
781	Look at all those teeth in there.
781	There is no animal like this anywhere.
782	Let's slide that one over there.
782	Whoa, whoa, whoa, big boy!
782	You're a little too hefty for this ride.
782	Safety first, eh? 30 bills?
782	What a rip off.
782	I told you.
782	Watch your step!
783	I'm going to California.
783	You're going to California.
783	And why should you go to California?
783	The United States saying, good enough for you?
783	A, I find citizen you are, yes?
783	You don't even know that California is in the United States.
783	What are you about?
783	I got a laugh, because you are so dumb.
783	You didn't even know that I was making a joke with you.
784	Hello and welcome to a pilot of sorts of a new series.
784	It will delve into the history of some of the world's worst scandals, some of you may know, and some you may not.
784	It's been inspired in part by an RTE program called Scanal.
784	Although, rather than focusing on events linked to Ireland, I plan to widen the scope of what I'll cover.
784	Well, without further delay, let's get started.
785	Yeah, I did some, I did some research to get ready for tonight, because like I said, I'm a real, the only thing I know about government is the reason we're here, which is that it doesn't work for us.
785	Like that's literally all I know.
785	That was kind of nice to get into.
785	But I did some research of how a bill becomes a law.
785	So I watched the Schoolhouse Rock video.
785	Yes, we all love it.
786	You, you the world!
786	You're full of surprises, aren't you?
786	I remember a few years back, watching some of those Resident Evil movies with Mila Jovovich and thinking, I can't get any worse than this.
786	Yeah, it feels like a simpler time.
786	But with 2021's final gasping breath that came out with Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City.
786	AKA, Welcome to Hell.
787	Hi everyone, welcome back to its Dwight Cooking Show.
787	Today I'll be giving you a tuna macaroni salad recipe.
787	Nice and easy.
787	Just a simple recipe.
787	Here is a list of my ingredients, my bell pepper, my green onions, white onions, half a teaspoon of salt for taste, black pepper, or if you have ground pepper, you can use it, my macaroni, three eggs that were going to be boiled and my tuna.
788	We are at Tukka Beach today.
788	Tukka Beach is a resort here in Sierra Leone.
788	I'm here with my cousins.
788	Should be a lovely day.
788	It's a really chill time on the beach.
788	Nothing too much is happening or nothing planned, but, oh, it looks like they might be a wedding reception.
788	Everybody's being married.
788	It seems like there's a wedding or some kind of engagement.
788	It looks beautiful out here.
788	Look at this.
789	For Raptor specialist Bob Anderson, the pioneer's attitude was simply arrogant and ignorant.
789	All birds of prey were just considered vermin.
789	I mean, they were all chicken hawks.
789	They were all bad birds, be it a bald eagle, golden eagle, a red to a hawk.
789	They were all shot.
790	And I'd like to start by turning to Dr. Vishal Sikka, the CEO of Emphasis.
790	Vishal, you're the son of a railways engineer.
790	You saw technology at that phase, and you're also a surfer, so you know all about dodging the waves.
790	What's the disruption that we most need to pay attention to, that's coming from the new technologies and why?
790	Why should we pay so much attention to the disruption?
791	To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there.
791	And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink.
791	So I went in with ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so.
791	And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antique in like an actual metal ornament.
791	After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well to supply that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments.
791	And that is how I finished off these antique brass bubbles.
791	Really simple and easy, but honestly, they look like real metal and they're beautiful.
792	GOOD RIDDANCE
793	The advancement of Humanity never ceased, even for a moment–during difficult times we grow and adapt once again.
793	The cities are as prosperous as ever, and our technological advancement is rising.
793	With our recent discovery of Ignniat, humanity has once skyrocketed past its peak; the greatest has yet to be achieved.
793	This grace of newfound knowledge could only be described as divine intervention - we humanity will be able to grace the gods with our presence in their land in the clouds.
793	Everyone within the company of Karascene has evaluated Ignniat and we sense a large potential within this mineral – worry not, Ignniat has not been evaluated to have any side effects or downsides of being mined, it has a higher chance to–
794	JANUARY 14th, 10:26 PM, 2543.
795	A click.
795	It had been reruns of this same stream, the day the world was ruined.
795	Dad always found himself turning the channel off when I was unable to tear my eyes away.
795	The somber face he gave me ensured a gut-wrenching feeling transpiring from deep within – I always feel bad when it plays, but it opens the floodgates to so many memories; granted they weren't very good ones.
795	Letting out a sigh, I slowly rose to my feet, gotta get my mind off things.
795	His saddened mood remained, and regularly I’d try to help ease his mood and at least give him a little bit of joy, but today; I’m tired.
796	I hold a relatively slow pace as I approach the door, giving a small holler to Dad.
796	“I’ll be heading out for a bit, dinner is in the fridge.”
796	No response.
796	Figures.
796	He usually hears me though, he’ll probably be fine.
796	Slowly closing the door behind me, I let another breathy sigh escape as the door completely shut.
796	Nearly forgetting, I place my hand on the cold, metallic scanner that locks the door.
796	If there was anything this apartment had, it was advanced tech, but then again; most places had notable technology–it had been a long time since anyone had used any other different technology.
797	The cold, rainy night ensued my long overdue walk–exploring the city of Paltricus was a privilege to those who’d been safe from the mutation via escape, or pure luck.
797	The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years.
797	It must be lonely in the great distant sky.
797	Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living.
797	Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat.
797	The mineral that appeased technology, and architecture was a great mineral that extended our foundation of life.
797	Public knowledge only knows so much about this mineral though, mainly because mainly because it’s kept under pretty tough wraps.
798	Removing myself from clouded thoughts, I found my way to my favorite coffee spot; most people avoid it because rumors were spread that a lapse was found in the area, which was what society has referred to those whom the virus has infected.
798	This never really disturbed me, I’ve had incredible luck my entire life, plus the owner is a great guy.
798	Who would pass up free coffee in exchange for talks and chats late at night?
799	Walking inside, a loud ring dispelled my discomfort as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled my lungs.
799	Anton, the man who owned the store, was of course the person behind the counter – the place was practically empty except for a few people in the back.
799	Approaching the counter, my feet tired from a long walk, I droop atop one of the stools and yawn.
799	I spot Anton bringing the regular thankfully.
799	“Hey Lilith, Long night?” his raspy voice echoed within the fractals of my brain, “Something of the sort,” I replied shallowly, more tired and tired by the second.
800	Ready to fix my fatigue, I took a few sips of the coffee placed in front of me.
800	“Business still down since that sighting..?” I spoke quietly, not attempting to scare away the remaining customers that Anton’s unit had.
800	He nodded, cleaning a glass with a rag – this place is technically a bar, but I never really came for drinks.
800	A few murmurs could be heard from behind, but for the most part, the conversation between me and Anton was held rather short tonight.
800	Waving him a small goodbye, I left the shop; with a little more energy than before.
801	Wandering the dark streets late at night wasn’t usually the best option, but honestly, it was better than staying in that stuffy apartment; hell most of the time you could hear the neighbors having sex more than you could hear your music.
801	With a quick, breathy sigh, I returned my gaze to the walk ahead–I’ll probably make my way towards Al’s Pawnshop; just a place I find junk that looks interesting, as a pastime.
801	Quick regret flushed over me as I heard footsteps close behind, maybe I'm overthinking it, but nobody hung around this place unless they wanted to get mugged, or beaten up.
801	It was popular for its mafia and gang activities...
802	Isn’t that funny?
802	We have half the manpower left, and we can’t even refrain from hurting one another.
802	I hastily sped up, Al’s was around the corner, so I would be fine inside.
802	A glance behind me ensured that I was no longer being tailed as I stood in front of a bright glowing sign that read, “Alborn’s Pawnshop!”
802	With slower steps, I entered once again–this place was more under the cover, as Alborn would often take in people who’d been mutated and snuck into Paltricus.
802	Upon opening the door, the lights had been shut off, interestingly enough–there was no Al.
802	No refugees.
802	Nothing.
802	Something wasn’t right here.
803	Stealthily I made my way towards the back of the store, murmurs and talking heard beyond a metal grate which took a few yanks to tear off.
803	Climbing into the vent was the safest and quietest option for me right now; climbing my way through, I’d pick up on conversations and talks between strangely dressed men.
803	I noticed Al inside, chained.
803	Figures he’d get caught eventually.
804	Alborn was a great guy, but this looked serious.
804	No need to stick my nose out for someone, especially when they seem like they’ve just gotten into trouble with every authority in the city.
804	Yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling.
804	Letting a silent sigh escape me, I slowly warped off the grate below, dropping down into the quiet room.
804	“Psst. Al.
804	Al!”
804	I whispered, giving a soft yell at his lack of response.
804	“Lilith?
804	What are you doing here..?
804	You’ve gotta leave, he’ll catch you.”
805	No shit, I silently voiced to myself.
805	Attempting to lockpick the chains that wrapped around his arms, voices closed in on our location, the faint footsteps growing ever louder.
805	“Quick!
805	Get back in the vent, and leave.
805	Do not come back.
805	If we meet again, it won’t be in this city.”
805	He said hurriedly, the flash of panic on his face didn’t help my nerves at all.
805	Listening to his advice.
805	I couldn’t bring myself to stay longer.
805	Fuck, Al.
805	I quickly ran for it after exiting the vent; it hurt a bit to lose such an invaluable friend.
805	Were they moving him to the...other city?
805	So many things were flicking through my slightly scattered mind, and most of them were angry but sad.
805	I’d done numerous kinds of research on the outer cities, and the capital of the infected, Alcatraz, which they named after the prison – felt like it fit the name pretty well from what I’d read.
805	Not to mention the unmutated had cut any remaining connecting land with infected land, it was...tragic.
806	The walk home was quiet, but so loud.
806	The thoughts infecting my brain were booming, and the regret of not having stayed to help flashed over multiple times.
806	I finally arrived home, almost brought to tears by the dreadful walk in the burst of sounds from the clouds above, the thunderous booms were enough to frighten any person sometimes.
806	Dad was already passed out on the couch, some rerun of an older movie, probably 10-12 years old; sighing, I quietly crept my way back to my room.
806	Flopping in the bed, I wasn’t able to keep my eyes open for long.
806	Before long, slumber crept up on me.
807	DETONATION
808	JANUARY 19th, 2:34 PM, 2543.
809	The days rolled past before I could even realize it.
809	It was a few days since Alborn was taken away – to where I had no clue, but I knew he was taken somewhere.
809	Those outfits seemed familiar, but no way was I going to figure it out on the first try.
809	Sighing, I placed my hands on the system in front of me, emanating a red and purple glow – I could hack the security, the place isn’t far, and I doubt they took measures...Maybe I shouldn’t.
809	Of course, against all morals, my fingers moved without my knowing, pulling up multiple screens; god I’m good.
809	I was pretty popular on a couple of websites, they referred to me as “WRAITH.”
809	Which was a pretty catchy name.
809	Granted my name on any site is WR417H, but I like to think the public came up with it.
810	Moving the surveillance onto my mobile device, I watched each one intently.
810	Nothing.
810	It was like they were never there.
810	That makes no sense.
810	Cameras had tight security, even with remote access.
810	How..?
810	ARGH.
810	I stood angrily, ready to remove some thoughts from my head – I made my way over, sliding on shoes and taking my keys.
810	“I’ll be back soon, Dad.”Silence.
810	Whatever, he didn’t usually respond, he was probably busy doing something more important than me anyway.
811	With a quick jolt, I felt a shiver enthrall its way down my spine as I made my way out of the apartment; weird.
811	Ignoring the feeling, I urged myself to head towards Al’s to investigate a little, but my legs moved towards Anton’s small bar – it was a pretty calm place, and I definitely needed to talk to someone.
811	Who better than a bartender who owes you something?
812	Irregularly, Anton’s was pretty busy; it was bustling with activity and new faces that I’ve never seen before – Anton was regularly the only worker, so knowing that he must be pretty stressed.
812	“Hey Barkeep, get me a coffee.”
812	I purposely spoke in a lower tone to throw him off a bit, a small chuckle escaping me seeing his sigh of relief after turning quickly.
812	“God, Lilith, don’t do that to me...” he softly let out, obviously tired.
812	“You seem pretty busy...you need some help?
812	Look’s like there's more than plenty of folks here.”
812	I huffed out, I do not want to help with these drunks, but I feel bad making this guy work alone out here.
812	“Could you?
812	I’ll pay you after...” he uttered with the eyes of a puppy, aimed straight at me.
812	Advanced War Tactics...
813	After changing into the small uniform, I helped around the bar a bit, it was pretty easy aside from the constant flirting and cat-calling from the people within the bar; but it didn’t really bother me that much to be honest.
813	I’ll talk to Anton after this shift, I still really need to get Al off my mind, though I know I’ll still investigate his place after this, but still...
814	A burst of flames erupted from Thassalin's jaws as the colossal Thraki set fire to a very specific patch of forest, then circled above, watching for moment.
814	Weirdly, as he had slowed down, the weird screaming noise from behind him had stopped.
814	Thassalin had forgotten he had passengers on his back.
815	"Come on, Tenuk, you've shapeshifted into a Thraki before!"
816	"My own flight is very different from being abruptly dragged off by a massive, pink dragon!"
817	"It's not that bad, right, Kayel?"
818	Kayel clearly didn't agree with Nyssi, he looked less black than normal and his claws had dug into Thassalin's back to the point that he'd made the Thraki bleed, but Thassalin clearly didn't seem to care.
818	That being said, Thassalin had realized he had scared his new friends and found a clearing to land in.
819	"I APOLOGIZE BUT I PICKED UP A SCENT.
819	I HAD TO DEAL WITH IT!"
820	"Did you have to drag us along as well?"
820	Tenuk snapped as he climbed off Thassalin's back, sliding down his tail.
820	"And we left Retvik behind!
820	We abandoned our big, strong, fighty guy!
820	How is he going to get to us?"
821	"He'll work it out..."
821	Nyssi tutted.
821	"Retvik's slow but he's not stupid."
822	"Yeah but can Retvik drive?"
823	Nyssi blinked and turned back to Tenuk.
823	"Of course he can drive."
824	"Have you ever seen Retvik drive a vehicle?
824	He doesn't own a truck like you do, nor have I seen him drive something like that little cute car Kayel has, and he only started going to work by car because you keep on driving us TO work.
824	He just has that bike of his."
825	A burst of laughter interrupted them.
825	Thassalin was suddenly overly amused, but no one could work out what he was laughing about.
825	It took a little too long for Thassalin to calm down.
826	"I AM SORRY, BUT I PICTURED YOUR LARGE, ARMOURED FRIEND ON A TINY LITTLE BIKE MEANT FOR TEMTHAN CHILDREN.
826	IT WAS HILARIOUS!
826	I WISH I HAD SOME FORM OF TELEPATHY.
826	IT IS A CHERISHED THOUGHT!
826	ONE I CANNOT SHARE!"
827	Kayel snickered, as he could imagine what Thassalin was thinking about.
827	"Yeah, fair.
827	But what did you pick up, and why did you fly off so quickly?"
828	Thassalin grunted, took off and disappeared briefly, before returning, dropping a carcass in front of Nyssi.
828	It was an Orothrack, a very rare, gold and white draconic creature.
828	But its head was missing.
828	"ANOTHER DEAD ONE.
828	I HEAR THEIR CRIES.
828	SMELL THEIR BLOOD.
828	I AM DRAWN TO PROTECT AND HUNT.
828	AS YISINI DEMANDS.
828	THE CREATURES, THEY ARE CLOSE."
829	The mighty Thraki suddenly froze.
829	Nyssi and Kayel also froze, their attention drawn to a gap in the clearing.
829	Something large and black was staring at them, hissing.
829	Whatever it was, it spread open two colossal pairs of wings and charged forward, aiming at Thassalin, not caring that it had to go through the three smaller beings.
829	Kayel and Tenuk only just managed to get to cover, but Nyssi found herself dragged along and almost thrown at Thassalin.
830	Thassalin responded to this attack by grabbing Nyssi and throwing her on his back with his insanely long, dextrous tail, before taking off into the air.
830	The black, two-winged creature quickly chased after them.
831	Kayel tutted as he drew his rifle from his back, then opened up a pouch, revealing a bandolier.
831	He slung the bandolier over his chest for easy access, but quickly realized that Nyssi, the Thraki and the monster were no longer visible.
832	"Hey, Tenuk, do you mind shapeshifting into something that can fly?"
832	Kayel asked.
833	"You want to chase after them?"
834	"Yeah, duh."
835	"But... one of them is a giant monster!"
836	"So?
836	I have a high-powered rifle in my hands, right now, ready to go.
836	I just need to be able to, you know, see it, so I can shoot it."
837	Tenuk hesitated, then stepped back, giving himself some space.
837	With a low, slightly pained grunt, Tenuk's body stretched out, his fur replaced with scales and his arms replaced with wings.
837	He quickly turned himself into a normal, light blue Thraki, but his eyes remained red.
838	"Climb on."
839	Being a more normal-looking Thraki, Tenuk now had proper plates of scales running down his back, but he'd also conveniently grown a pair of spikes on his back for Kayel to hold on to.
839	It took a little too long for Tenuk to get airborne, but once he was in the air, he quickly orientated himself and tried to give chase.
840	However, Tenuk and Kayel quickly realized they weren't alone.
840	A second dark creature shot out from beneath them, and Tenuk only just managed to avoid a collision.
841	"I guess that's the other big scary monster that Lanex was worried about?"
841	Kayel frowned as he attempted to take a shot at the second beast, missed and swiftly reloaded.
842	Tenuk didn't respond, he was too busy concentrating on flying towards Nyssi and Thassalin, even though the other creature was chasing them.
842	Kayel awkwardly turned himself around, so he could face the monster.
842	The fact that it was giving chase was good news in Kayel's eyes, as it made it easier for him to aim and fire.
842	Two shots passed through the creature's top wings, and it roared in pain, disappearing back below the trees.
842	Whether it was still following them, Kayel wasn't sure, but it certainly wouldn't have been able to keep up.
843	Up ahead, Nyssi was clinging on for dear life as Thassalin flailed around, blasting the blackened monster with bursts of flame.
843	While the creature was definitely injured, it seemed very pissed off and unwilling to back off, and the fire balls didn't seem to be doing as much as they should.
843	As Thassalin straightened himself out though, Nyssi took this as an opportunity to pull out her own weapon, a trusty shotgun.
843	Sure, it wasn't meant for this sort of thing, but surely the scattershot would at least deter the black beast?
844	No, clearly not.
844	The creature just hissed and tried to fly directly into Thassalin.
844	Thankfully, despite his size, Thassalin was nimble enough to get out of the way, but Nyssi couldn't help but scream as she very nearly lost her grip on Thassalin's overly smooth scales.
845	"HOW DO WE KILL THEM?"
845	Nyssi shouted.
846	"AIM FOR THEIR HEADS!"
847	"THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY!"
848	Thassalin hissed, then circled round, closer to the mountain he called home.
848	The dark beast followed, but somewhat panicked as a blast of fire hit it from behind.
848	The creature hadn't realised it was no longer alone.
848	It panicked further as Thassalin slowed down then thwacked his tail into the side of the beast's head, knocking it off course.
849	Snarling and hissing, the creature flew upwards, spitting into the air.
849	Everything suddenly went dark, as if the monster was sucking the light from the sky itself, replacing it with a cloud of perpetual night.
850	No longer able to see, Thassalin tried to retreat, but found himself scraping against the top of the treeline, before crashing into a clearing.
850	The creature seemed to know exactly where Thassalin had fallen and headed straight for him, taking the dark cloud with it.
851	"Kayel!"
851	Tenuk exclaimed as he glided out of the cloud and began circling, trying to spot Nyssi and Thassalin in the darkness below.
851	"What do we do?
851	Kayel..?
851	Kayel, where are you?"
852	Below, Nyssi scrambled to her feet.
852	She was pretty sure she had broken something, but her weird, unnatural healing powers had already kicked in.
852	The same couldn't have been said for Thassalin, who was lying in a lump, resting against the one tree that hadn't collapsed under his weight.
852	Nyssi did her best to try and reach Thassalin but she could barely see more than a couple of meters in front of her.
852	Everything was pitch black and engulfed in unholy shadows.
852	And in said shadows, something was screaming and screeching.
853	A horrible, clubbed tail smashed into the ground near Nyssi, knocking her over.
853	She noticed though that the tail was flailing, not aiming at her.
853	The creature, what little Nyssi could see and hear of it, was snarling and clawing at the shadows it had created.
853	Something was teleporting through the darkness, stabbing at the monster, confusing it.
854	A gunshot suddenly filled the air, and the monster fell silent, collapsing on the ground and remaining still.
854	The darkness all around them dissipated, revealing what had happened.
854	Standing on top of the creature was Kayel, holding his rifle and breathing heavily.
855	"That was... one of the weirder shadowjumps I've ever done...
855	Thanto kat'olon..."
855	Kayel gasped for air.
855	His eyes somehow were glowing black, and a dark energy drifted across his body.
855	However, as he spoke, the colour returned to Kayel's organic plating and his eyes turned back to their normal yellow.
856	It took a moment for Nyssi to work out what had happened.
856	They were all aware that Kayel had weird shadow powers, ones that he rarely used because most considered them unholy and rather terrifying.
856	But Nyssi didn't know that Kayel could use those powers in any sort of darkness.
856	And, by the way Kayel was acting, he was pretty surprised as well.
857	"You alright?"
857	Nyssi couldn't help but ask.
858	"Yeah, I'm fine.
858	I killed something, I'll be good in a minute."
858	Kayel examined his handiwork, as Tenuk made his way down and landed next to him, shapeshifting back into his normal Spast form.
859	Now that the creature was no longer moving, they could better see what it was.
859	Its skin was pitch black and slimy, but the slime remained firmly attached to the creature's body.
859	It had four wings and four limbs, all of which were tipped with long, thin talons, and two straight horns stuck out from its skull.
860	Before Tenuk and Kayel could ask what the fuck they were looking at, something screeched and leaped out from a nearby bush.
860	However, it never made contact, as a familiar vehicle crashed into the side of it, causing the monster to skid to a halt by Nyssi's feet.
860	Not taking any chances, Nyssi grabbed her shotgun and immediately fired into its skull, killing the creature instantly.
861	"Oops..."
861	Retvik muttered from the driver's seat, before awkwardly switching the engine off and climbing out of the truck.
861	"I, uh, did not mean to do that.
861	Are you all well?"
862	"You missed basically all the action!"
862	Tenuk tutted.
862	"Where were you?"
863	"You all did somewhat leave me behind.
863	I got here as quickly as I could..."
863	Retvik sighed.
863	"May I ask, what are those horrible things?"
864	Retvik's question was thankfully answered by Thassalin, who had picked himself back up.
864	He was covered in cuts and scratches and seemed a bit dazed, but he didn't seem too badly injured.
865	"YOU KILLED THE CORRUPTIIDS!
865	THE INFECTED MONSTERS.
865	CREATURES LEFT HERE WHEN THE CORRUPTION ATTACKED YOUR GODS."
866	"You mean... the horrible god monster thing that we... helped kill?"
866	Tenuk stuttered.
867	"YES.
867	VERY MUCH SO.
867	THERE MAY BE MORE.
867	BUT I COULD NOT SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD.
867	I LACK A GUN.
867	ALSO TWO AGAINST ONE IS UNFAIR, YES?"
867	Thassalin made his way over to Kayel and patted him on the head.
867	"THANK YOU, LITTLE ONE.
867	YOU REMIND ME OF MY OLD FRIEND ARKADIN.
867	EXCEPT LESS MURDEROUS AND LESS CAPABLE OF KILLING UNIVERSES."
868	"Uh... thanks...
868	I guess..."
868	Kayel shrugged.
868	"So, uh, are we done here?"
869	Nyssi shrugged, then grabbed her camera, taking some photos of the definitely now dead beasts.
869	She then pulled out her favourite dagger, her fancy, death-god-y one, and started cutting off one of the creature's horns, before moving on to the other one.
869	However, just as Nyssi finished, the creatures suddenly began to burn up, and quickly turned into a pile of ashes.
869	The same thing happened to the horns Nyssi had cut off.
870	"Well... that is both convenient and inconvenient..."
870	Nyssi sighed.
870	"I suppose at least I got pictures?"
871	Prologue
872	“Please!”
872	Queen Eirwen begged, “don’t send her away!
872	She’s just a child!”
872	The Ice King looked down at his wife from his throne, his royal advisor next to him.
872	She had given birth to a girl.
872	He scowled at the thought.
873	The girl in question looked a lot like her mother; pale blue eyes and white hair decorated with blue strands.
873	The Ice King thought a daughter made him look weak.
873	After all, he had only had sons up until this point.
874	“The only options you have are to kill the child or send it out to the wilderness.
874	This is her punishment for your wrongdoing, Eirwen .” He spat out her name as if it was poison.
874	He always did.
875	Frostfell was not always one kingdom.
875	It was split in two, the North and the South.
875	In the North, the non magical kingdom.
875	To the South, a kingdom full of fantastical displays of power.
875	Due to the North’s greed, the two kingdoms clashed in a never ending war, until the South offered a truce.
876	The South was desperate, and their royal family would do anything to stop the bloodshed.
876	They offered their only princess to be queen of the North and bear a son to be the future king.
876	Then, the South would join with the North to make one kingdom.
876	The North accepted, and Princess Eirwen married Prince Akull.
877	“I beg you, my king, in return for the safety of my child, do whatever you want to me, lock me up, banish me, or even kill me.”
877	Queen Eirwen pleaded, holding her child tightly in her arms.
878	The Ice King looked down at his queen, disgust from his eyes.
878	Maybe, just maybe, he would have mercy on her.
878	The woman who he had been with for twenty-two years, the one who always cared for him at his lowest times, the one who had given birth to his sons.
879	“Very well.
879	The child may live in the palace.”
879	He started, earning a sigh from the queen.
879	“But,” he added.
879	“You will be executed.”
880	A shared look of horror came from the advisor and Queen Eirwen herself.
880	She slowly looked down at the floor.
880	“Yes, my king.”
880	She bowed.
881	The Ice King ordered the royal advisor to take the queen’s daughter to one of Eirwen’s vacant rooms.
881	Once that was done he ordered the guards to bring Eirwen to the execution site, where all the townspeople could see.
882	As the guards escorted her to the site, the townspeople cried out in outrage at seeing their only queen- and the nicest one- about to be killed.
882	Some people were crying, some people were shouting and trying to attack the guards, and others were wondering why this was happening; but they all shared the same basis.
883	“Let her go!”
884	“Why are they doing this to her?”
885	As Eirwen approached the wooden pole, the most feared person in the kingdom showed up.
885	The fire user.
885	The former Queen Eirwen was going to be burned to death.
885	Nobody deserved that death, not even the criminals.
885	It was the most cruel thing you could do to a person in Frostfell.
886	Eirwen was tied up to the wooden pole and the king started speaking about how the queen betrayed all of them.
886	The people of Frostfell refused to believe it and never accepted his words.
886	Then, the fire user lit the pole on fire, and a single tear rolled down the former queen’s face.
887	“Live on, Kari.”
887	That was the end of the reign of Queen Eirwen.
888	Silence in the Halls
889	Tap, tap, tap was all you could hear from the farthest room on the left in the south wing of the eternally cold palace.
889	The servants passing by always wondered what was in the room, scared of what was inside.
889	Rumors danced around the halls by the maids.
889	It was thought that the Ice King’s deceased wife, Eirwen, was in that room, waiting to be let out.
890	They couldn’t be more wrong.
890	Ivory thought, walking toward the south wing, as the help roamed the walls whispering to each other.
890	They don’t know what’s in there at all.
891	The rumors, of course, also applied to them as they were the only person allowed to enter the room.
892	Knock knock.
892	“Lady Kari, are you in there?”
892	Ivory whispered to the intricate door, which was laid in snowflakes and a crown, the symbol of the royal family.
893	They wondered if she would actually let them enter, unlike the previous times they went to ask.
893	I still have a bruise from the last time.
893	Ivory chuckled from the memory.
893	Kari had thrown a book at their shoulder, but when she saw who it was, she apologized immediately.
894	A single tap came from inside, seeming to say that she was there, after all, there was nowhere to go.
895	“May I come in?”
895	Ivory asked, remembering the time they went in without asking.
896	One tap came from inside.
896	Yes, it seemed to say.
896	Ivory shivered, from the cold and the sound.
896	It felt kind of weird to Ivory hearing a noise coming from a presumably vacant room, even though they have been going into there for years.
897	“I’m coming in.”
897	Ivory said, slowly opening the door.
897	The sight they saw in the room was unusual , by normal people’s standards , but not unexpected.
897	Papers were everywhere.
897	Books were scattered about, the desk was broken, and there were multiple ice sculptures scattered about.
897	There were no windows and little to no light.
897	It was also colder than the rest of the palace (which was saying a lot).
897	The room looked like a snowstorm blew it all out of place.
898	The girl in the room was curled up onto her bed, currently wrapped in her comforter as she read one of her notebooks.
898	A small lantern lighting up the space.
899	“Which notebook is that?”
899	Ivory asked, sitting down next to Kari on her bed.
900	She flipped to a blank page and wrote the date on it.
900	Under it, she wrote, “5/11/648 -12/13/648.”
901	“Reviewing old memories?”
901	Ivory inquired, looking at the old notebook.
901	Kari nodded.
901	“Do you think that they will let you out for Christmas?
901	It’s only a few days away.”
902	Kari tapped twice on the lantern.
902	No, as Ivory predicted.
902	The Ice King never let Kari out, as she was seen as “a flaw” in his eyes.
902	She was born mute and was the only girl in her family, as it was all made up of boys.
903	Ivory was too, in their own special way.
903	When Ivory came out as nonbinary, it seemed like the world changed too.
903	They were given the jobs that would make them spend time alone for most of the time, as a punishment for being different.
904	They were also forced to work as the princess’ servant.
904	They didn’t mind it much thought, as they got a friend too.
905	“It’s your birthday soon, isn’t it?”
905	Ivory asked, remembering that the princess’ birthday was in a few days.
905	Kari nodded, a sad glint in her light blue eyes.
906	“Do you want to celebrate?”
906	They asked, reflecting on the last time she answered it.
907	No.
907	Kari tapped out.
907	Ivory knew that it was a hard subject for her.
907	It was the day that she was confined to her room and her mother was banished.
907	Ivory was only a baby when it happened, but they remembered the outrage the servants and townspeople were in.
907	They heard Queen Eirwen was a nice queen, but also weirdly predicted things that would happen.
908	“So... whatcha wanna do?”
908	They asked.
908	Kari looked up at them, teeming with excitement.
908	She handed Ivory a paper.
908	When they looked down at it however...
909	6in x 6in painting canvas
910	White, varying shades of blue paint
911	6 different sizes of paint brushes
912	Easel
913	“You want me to get these things for you?”
913	Ivory turned toward the silent princess, who was tapping a lot, pig tails swishing back and forth.
913	“Yes?”
913	They giggled slightly as they saw the normally withdrawn princess was passionate about something.
913	It was the first time she had ever asked for something not related to books that was outside her room.
914	“Okay!
914	See ya later?”
914	Ivory asked, standing up and weaving through the mess of papers and notebooks.
915	Kari nodded, going back to reviewing her memories and curling up in her thick comforter.
916	They exited the room, relieved that the princess was finally pushing out of her comfort zone and asking for things outside of her power, like paint.
917	They walked through the halls again, trying to tune out the whispers of the maids again.
918	“ I heard that she’s getting possessed by Queen Eirwen, that’s why she’s always going to that room.”
919	“I heard that she eats children in that room.”
920	“ She looks like a man, isn’t that wrong?”
921	They covered their ears, as tuning them out wasn’t working.
921	They made their way to the royal painter’s room, which was on the east wing, second door on the left.
922	Ivory approached the door that was just as intricate as Kari’s.
922	On it was the White Dragon, one of the 6 primordial dragons, who allegedly created Frostfell.
922	It would make sense for the painter to have it on his door though, he liked history.
923	They opened the door, expecting the normal sight.
923	Paint splotches everywhere, pencils and papers scattered across the room, easels covering up every last inch of wall.
923	Unexpectedly, there was a different sight to be found.
923	It was all clean, and there was a red velvet background and a stool in front of it.
923	On the stool was Crown Prince Aquilo, getting his portrait done.
924	“Ah, good morning, Ivory!
924	Care to watch your future king get his portrait done?”
924	Aquilo inquired, winking at Ivory.
925	“Sorry, princey,” They said, partially ignoring him and searching for the things that their silent friend wanted.
925	“I’m just here to get art supplies.”
926	“Aw baby girl’s gonna leave so soon?”
926	Aquilo asked, “But I wanted to see you!”
927	“Well I didn’t.”
927	Ivory found the art supplies on their list and put it in a crate that they found.
927	“And I’m not a girl.”
928	The prince didn’t think this though.
928	“Aw baby, you know it’s just a phase!
928	You’re going to grow out of it when you’re older!”
928	He said, slurring his words.
929	“I have to go.”
929	They said, suddenly feeling uncomfortable when the prince said back.
929	Remembering all the bad things people said about their gender identity.
929	I really want to get away from him.
930	“Leaving so soon?”
930	The prince instantaneously appeared at the door, ignoring the cries of one royal painter.
931	“This isn’t the way a future king should act!”
931	They demanded.
932	“Nobody’s gonna know.
932	The people won’t believe you and the painter won’t say anything if he values his life.”
932	He looked back at the painter for a second, then leaned closer to Ivory.
932	“Whatddya say about going on a date?”
932	They shivered.
932	Sure, they had heard multiple threats in the past, but it had never come from a prince, let alone the one next in line to be king.
933	“Do you even know what the word ‘no’ means?”
933	They spat out, pushing the crown prince away from them.
934	“Nope.”
934	Aquilo answered back, smiling.
934	Of course the crown prince who gets everything he wants doesn’t know what the word even means.
935	Ivory rolled their eyes.
935	“Why do you even want to go on a date with me of all people?
935	You have like, I don’t know, 100 suitors?”
936	He cut in, still smiling, “500 actually.”
936	He threw his hair back, swishing it in the cold air.
937	“See!
937	Why me of all people?
937	I’m the palace menace.”
937	They hugged their arms.
938	“You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.”
938	Aquilo puts one digit under their chin and forces Ivory to look up at him.
939	Chapter 1
940	Cohren
941	0430 Itania time.
941	Cohren hated waking up this early.
941	Mainly because it was his responsibility to wake everyone else up in his company.
941	Silently stepping out of his bunk, he put on his combat fatigues, throwing on his assault vest, and packed up his belongings from his locker, being careful with a particular small box.
941	He shoulded his rifle and put his helmet on a small hook connected to his belt.
941	It had all its fixing, respirator, goggles, everything needed.
941	After checking his ammo pouches, he quietly walked out of the barracks, mud and ice squelching under his boots.
942	He took a lighter from his jacket pocket and a cig from the other.
942	Lighting it, he took a small drag before opening the door slightly.
942	Over the last week he had to get creative when waking the men and women under his command.
942	He stopped using the preset wake up alarm, half the time it never worked, when all that came from the speakers was a light hiss.
943	“Waking them up” Cohren turned to see 2nd Lieutenant Nemic walking up.
944	“Yup” Cohren responded.
945	“What did you plan on using this time?”
946	Before he could answer, the door opened and Harris, Craith, and a few others hurried out, already fully dressed and kitted out.
947	“Morning,” Craith said.
948	“What woke you guys up?”
948	Cohren asked.
949	“Well, One, we didn’t want to see what you had in mind for waking the company up today.
949	Second, the first Shock Troops to get up get first pick of the morning chow” One of the men, Ravik, answered.
949	“And you know for a fact how bad they can get”
950	“You make a good point Specialist,” Cohren said.
950	He reached in and flicked a switch.
950	An alarm sounded inside of the barracks, loud and screeching.
950	He heard muffled shouting inside and people stumbling about.
951	“Jeez Valturi,” Nemic stated.
951	“You’d think they would have learned by now to wake up when you did”
952	“Well my buddys from boot camp here did” Cohren motioned to Harris, Craith and Ravik.
952	“But then again, their squad and platoon leader’s, they know to wake up before their units.
953	Seconds later the rest of the company came streaming out.
953	They all had everything they needed, from personal items to needed gear.
953	A few of the newer recruits look disoriented, others more annoyed.
954	“Morning everyone” Cohren said in a cheery voice.
955	“With all respect sir, why do you have to wake us up like that?”
955	One of the Shock Troopers, a corporal, asked.
956	“Cause the regular alarms are shit.
956	And because Daybreak doesn't sleep in” Cohren stated.
957	“Make sure you have all your personal belongings,” Cohren continued.
957	As a 1st Lieutenant and Company XO, it was his responsibility to oversee and assist the company with the Company leader, Captain Boradin Shaw .
957	“We won’t be returning.
957	Sergeants and 2nd lieutenants, I'm giving you and your squads fifteen minutes to make final checks and grab rations for the day”
958	The members of Exodus company quickly dispersed.
958	They were a part of the 2nd Shocktrooper Division, 2nd Army.
958	They were originally two separate companies, Cohort and Dagger, before being consolidated.
958	They were a cracked company, and Cohren felt mixed feelings about being promoted to 1st Lieutenant, mainly due to the reasons.
959	Cohren and Nemic, the leader of 1st Platoon, walked together under the light of the FOB's many lights, powered by generators.
959	Most were tinted red to help keep them hidden from enemy bombers.
959	Daybreak had resorted to Wild Weasel attacks, both in the air and on the ground, to combat them.
960	“Another day, another task for Hell’s Frontrunners” Nemic started with a dry laugh.
960	“Where are they sending us?”
961	“A FOB outside Ianlos.
961	We are being sent to help support the ground assault” Cohren answered, taking a drag from his cigarette.
961	Half of him blamed Craith for getting him into smoking, but a year of combat does a lot to you, so he didn’t say anything.
962	“Shit.
962	Its getting bad on the front, '' Nemic muttered.
962	“All the news leaving this place is ‘Support the war effort.
962	Send aid to the Kurgan Front’ how about sending aid to the Howland Front”
963	“Amen brother” Cohren said as he flicked the remains of the cigarette into the mud.
963	“Anyway, we're heading out with the 1st armored platoon, so we don’t have to walk.
963	Captain Shaw should be their”
964	“Shaw got us a ride?”
964	Nemic asked, a little surprised.
965	“Yup.
965	Honestly, he isn’t as bad as I thought he was.
965	I mean, he’s not great, but he isn’t unbearable”
966	Cohren lifted his thumb and index finger to his throat mic, shifting his pack on his back while he did.
966	“All units in Exodus Company, meet at Motor Pool West when you're finished.
966	We are heading out with the 1st Armored Platoon at 0500”
967	Every few seconds he got a response from the squad leaders.
967	Haris, Craith, and Ravik had all been low ranking NCO when they all got there.
967	All four of them had been good friends since basic back on Earth.
967	It felt so long ago now since Cohren had met them, even though it couldn’t have been two years ago.
967	They were squad leaders, But Craith was now leading 2nd Platoon as of a week ago, after the previous leader had gotten medically discharged after catching a bullet from a Daybreak sniper.
968	Walking up to the motor pool, Cohren and Nemic’s eye fell on a group of around eight Kronos Main Battle Tanks and four Strykers.
968	Their crew milled about, making sure their war machines were ready to go.
968	Cohren’s gaze soon found Captain Boradin Shaw, who was talking with the armored platoon’s commander.
968	As they walked up, Shaw looked over and walked up, his usually cold face masking all emotions.
969	“Lieutenant Nemic...Lieutenant Valturi...”
969	He said Cohren was slower, glancing at Cohren’s pistol holster before glancing up again.
969	“I assume that the company is ready”
970	“Yes sir.
970	There should be on their way now, we gave them time to grab rations from the mess” At 0500 sharp, Exodus company assembled at the motor pool.
970	Shaw stepped onto a box and began to speak.
971	“Where are moving out to FOB I-131, fifty miles outside of Ianlos.
971	We are to support the ongoing siege and later attack of Ianlos to flush out the insurgency there.
971	From there we will have a foothold and the base of the mountains” Shaw explained.
971	“Get with your squads and mount up”
972	The company dispersed, joining together in their squads and their sergeants had them mount up on one of the tanks.
972	Cohren pulled himself onto one of the tanks farther up on the convoy, joining Nemic, Craith, and two new recruits.
972	Cohren remembered them arriving a few days ago, but didn’t know much about them.
972	Sitting on the side, dangling his legs on the side, he adjusted his pack and radio set, which connected to his earpiece and throat mic.
973	“Hey Cohren, does Harris still have Snowball?”
973	Nemic asks as they got settled in.
974	“You mean his chicken he stole?”
974	Cohren remembered the morning they had stolen him from a farm.
974	“Yeah, i'm pretty sure”
975	Cohren glanced over to one of the other tanks and spotted Harris with his squad.
975	From the back of his pack he could just make out the movement of a small chicken moving its head around, scanning the surroundings.
976	“Yup, he still has him” Cohren answered as the tank's turret hatch clanked open and its commander came into view.
977	“All tanks were moving out” The commander started calmly but clearly into his headset.
977	The engines of a platoon of tanks and Strykers roared to life as they started moving forward.
977	The Kronos Cohren was on jolted as its break released and moved forward, getting into formation.
977	The tanks took up a wedge formation as they moved across the Itania plains.
977	The winter storms had frozen over the wetlands and forests, but the mud always remained.
978	After around an hour, one of the new recruits, Cohren, remembered his name being Orson, spoke up.
978	“Lieutenant, you’ve been here since the start of the war, right?”
979	“Yup, Operation Firestorm,” Cohren answered.
979	“We thought it would be over in a few weeks, but...we underestimate them”
980	“Underestimated is putting it lightly” Nemic joined in the conversation.
980	“They had more weapons and manpower than we were prepared for.
980	They were able to shoot down The UFS Revenant in the first two weeks, and just last month the Erebus.
980	Hell, we should see it from the route were taking”
981	“Well, I’ll stand defiantly for the Federation” Orson said defiantly.
981	“I’ll not let those terrorist scare me”
982	“You say that now, but from what I have seen, most fresh eighteen year old recruits like yourself dive to cover as soon as you hear a gunshot” Craith stated.
983	“I guess we’ll find out,” Cohren said with a laugh.
983	Orson didn’t continue the conversation.
984	“Exodus XO, Exodus CO” Cohrens radio crackled.
984	“We're picking up heat signatures 350 yards out, 20 degrees right”
985	Cohren pulled himself up to the top of the tank and pushed his Optic Goggles.
985	Switching them to Thermal, he could see heat signatures in the distance.
986	“Yup, I see them” Cohren responded, using his throat mic.
987	“Enemy’s?”
987	The other recruit, Natayla, asked.
988	“Can’t tell,” Cohren stated.
988	He reached for his mic and spoke.
988	“Exodus Company, hold fire unless fired upon, let's draw them out
989	As they drew closer, the little heat signatures turned from blobs to more distinct shapes.
989	As they drew closer, one of them ran for something and grabbed it before rusing back to the small ridge they were on.
989	The figures dropped down into firing positions.
990	“We got contacts” Shaw shouted through the radio as orange tracers fired from the ridge.
990	Bullets pinged off the tanks side as Shock Troopers leaped off the tanks, taking cover behind them.
990	An anti missile rocked, streaked by and slammed into the ground behind the formation, exploding and throwing debris onto one of the tanks.
990	Another slammed into the side of a Stryker, a APS-Cerberus, and exploded.
990	Its crew scrambled out and dove for cover as the ammo cooked off.
991	“Iron 1-2 and 1-3, 25 degrees right, 300 yards.
991	Open fire” The tank platoon commander shouted over the radio.
991	Iron 1-2 and 1-3 opened fire, their shells streaking towards the ridge and exploded, sending mud and rock into the air.
992	“Send in the Senti’s” Knoxx, who was watching the ridge through binocs, shouted.
992	The back to one of the Cerberus’s opened and an unarmed soldier stepped out, wearing a special headset.
992	He shouted orders into a square microphone and two Senti’s, formally known as Sentinels, rushed out.
992	Their skinny metallic arms and legs swung forward as they broke into a sprint.
992	They were armed, but their weapons were slung to their back.
993	“Kill or capture?”
993	Craith asked as they watched.
994	“Looks like capture” Cohren guessed as the two Sentinels disappeared into the cloud of ash and smoke.
994	Shouting and gunshots echoed from the ridge, but quickly ceased.
994	A moment later the two sentinels marched back, pulling someone behind them, their boots dragging behind them.
994	When they reached the safety of the platoon they threw the figure to the ground, he grunted in pain as they landed hard in the mud and snow.
995	Shaw walked up to the figure, who was starting to get up.
995	He then turned to one of the Sentinels.
995	“How many?”
996	“Three dead, sir” The Sentinel answered.
996	“The rest fled on foot”
997	Shaw nodded and turned towards Cohren and Criath, who were standing close by.
997	“Would you two be so kind as to stow this man away?”
