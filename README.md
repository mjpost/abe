# Quick Start


Set up your environment:
```
conda create -n abe python=3.11
conda activate abe
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inputs

Input streams are tab-separated dictionaries with the inputs.

Using a series of simple bash commands, we can create our input stream.

```
echo "This is a test." | python ensembling/build/bilingual-no-tags > input.1
echo "This is a test." | python ensembling/build/src-tgt eng_Latn deu_Latn > input.2
```

Then we can paste these files together:

```
paste input.1 input.2 | python ensembling/ensemble.py -m rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25 facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M -l 256 beam
```

You can run with the flag `-d` to see the beams at each time step.

```
paste input.1 input.2 | python ensembling/ensemble.py -m rewicks/baseline_en-de_64k_ep25 facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M -l 256 -d beam
```

* A small note on running is that you need a flag between `-m` (a `nargs='*'` argument) and `beam` or you will get an `ArgParse`:

```
ensemble.py: error: the following arguments are required: command
```

# Repository Structure

## Ensembling Code

All code to do our method of ensembling can be found in the `ensembling` directory. The important files include `ensemble.py` which contains the main function; `models.py` which has the model wrappers for each model to maintain it's own hidden state; `search.py` which has our cube-pruning-esque search algorithm. `utils.py` has some functions to help with tokenization.


## Data

### Inputs

For all our experiments, we use WMT24 data (en-XX, but mostly en-de).
The raw inputs can be found in `refs`. These were made via commands such as:

```
sacrebleu -t wmt24 -l en-de --echo src > wmt24.en-de.en
sacrebleu -t wmt24 -l en-de --echo ref > wmt24.en-de.de
```

#### Creation

These inputs are unsegmented (multiple sentences per line) which can make some machine translation models add or remove content. To circumvent these issues, we first segment these files into sentences. We then translate, and then reconcatenate. This requires an intermediate file (the sentences with the associated line numbers). We create this using `ersatz`:

```
cat wmt24.en-de.en | awk '{print NR "\t" $0}' | ersatz -m en -C 1 > wmt24.en-de.en.sentences
```

Our ensembling code requires `jsonl` inputs. We provide several scripts to automatically create these from plain text inputs. All scripts are in `ensembling/build/`

1. `bilingual-no-tags` creates inputs for a traditional encoder-decoder model which takes the input line as encoder input and has no additional special tags. We use these for our Marian `en-de` models.
2. `empty` creates an empty input. This would be used for a traditional decoder-only model that does not take prompts.
3. `prompt` creates input for both LLAMA and Tower specifically for translation. This is highly constrained to the set of languages we cover but we provide both 0-shot and 3-shot options. Calling looks like `echo "This is a test." | python ensembling/build/prompt llama3-0-shot English German`
4. `src-tgt` creates input for both M2M and NLLB by taking the source language token and the target language token. Calling looks like `echo "This is a test." | python ensembling/build/src-tgt eng_Latn deu_Latn`


The processed inputs (`jsonl`) can be found in `input_data`. They are labelled by model, and language pair.


### Outputs

#### Ensembling

Outputs that were generated by our ensembling method can be found at `translations/wmt24/$LANGUAGE_PAIR`. The `sentences` directory contains the sentence-level translations. The `targets` directory contains the concatenated translations that align to the original reference file.

They were created by calling `translation.sh`

#### Baselines

##### Simple Translations

Outputs that were generated natively (as if the model was run alone) can be found at `baselines/simple-translations/outputs`. Similar to the above, the `sentences` directory contains the sentence-level translations, while the `targets` directory contains the concatenanted translations that align to the original reference file.

These files were created by calling `baselines/simple-translations/scripts/*.py` (depends on specific model)

##### Linear Interpolation

Outputs that were generated using a more traditional linear interpolation of the log probabilities (only for our models which guarantee the same vocabulary) can be found at `baselines/interpolation/outputs`. Again, the `sentences` directory contains the sentence-level translations, while the `targets` directory contains the concatenanted translations that align to the original reference file.

These files were created by calling `baselines/interpolation/interpolate-translate.py`

# Scoring

All scores are handled in the `scoring` directory. We score both `BLEU` and `COMET`.

* `bleu-scores` is generated by `bleu.py` and creates a file of BLEU scores of our ensembled outputs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL_ONE`, `MODEL_TWO`, and `BLEU_SCORE` respectively.
* `comet-scores` is generated by `comet.py` and creates a file of COMET scores of our ensembled outputs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL_ONE`, `MODEL_TWO`, and `COMET_SCORE` respectively.
* `simple-bleu-scores` is generated by `simple-bleu.py` and creates a file of BLEU scores of the individual model outputs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL` and `BLEU_SCORE`
* `simple-comet-scores` is generated by `simple-comet.py` and creates a file of COMET scores of the individual model outputs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL` and `COMET_SCORE`
* `interpolate-bleu-scores` is generated by `interpolate-bleu.py` and creates a file of BLEU scores of the models ensembled via linear interpolation of the log probs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL_ONE`, `MODEL_TWO`, and `BLEU_SCORE` respectively.
* `interpolate-comet-scores` is generated by `interpolate-comet.py` and creates a file of COMET scores of the models ensembled via linear interpolation of the log probs. The format is `tsv` where the columns are `MODEL_ONE`, `MODEL_TWO`, and `COMET_SCORE` respectively.


# Adding a New Model

The main file to edit is `utils.py` which has a variable called `TOKENIZER_CONFIG`.
This is a series of variables to tell our code how tokenization is handled.
So long as the new model is reasonably similar to these standard tokenization modes, it should be added in seamlessly.
Recall that we detokenize to byte strings for agreement comparison, so [de-]tokenization is extremely important to get correct.

For example:

```
    "facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M": {
        "lstrip": False,
        "special_character": SPIECE_UNDERLINE,
        "begin_word": True,
        "byte_map": BYTE_MAP,
        "add_space": True
    },
```

is the tokenization scheme for NLLB.
In order to add a new model, you add a new key with the huggingface model id.

`lstrip`: Does the Tokenizer use lstrip on word beginnings? i.e., if I decode `▁Hello` does it decode as `Hello` or `[SPACE]Hello`.
`special_character`: what is the whitespace special character. Common exampls are `▁` or `Ġ`.
`begin_word`: Does this special character begin the word?
`byte_map`: The mapping of how the vocabulary stores bytes to the underlying byte. For example, many SPM models store as a string `<0xBYTE>`
`add_space`: Do we need to add a space to the beginning of the string? This is typically because the model removes spaces at the beginning of sentences.
